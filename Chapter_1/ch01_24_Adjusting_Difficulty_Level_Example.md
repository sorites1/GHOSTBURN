### Adjusting Difficulty Level: Step-by-Step

Adjusting the Difficulty Level  of a roll is a joint activity carried out by the GM and the player, together.

| Step | Description                                                                                   | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The player states what their character wants to do.                                           | Player: *My character is trying to convince Rico the street vendor to give her a hot Cup-O-Kaffe.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2    | The GM identifies the skill action to use, as well as the base Difficulty Level for the roll. | GM: *OK, that's Persuade, and you'll roll that with Presence. Persuade uses the target's Wits as the Difficulty Level, and Rico's Wits is Moderate (10), so that's the base DL for your roll.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3    | The GM announces each modifier that raises the DL. See the Exceeding Extreme (22) sidebar.    | GM: *Rico’s Attitude is currently \[Neutral\] towards you, so that doesn’t change anything, but he also has three qualities: \[Loves Dogs\], which doesn’t apply here, and \[Needs the Money\], which does. He’s also got \[Grumpy\] and that applies too. That raises the Difficulty Level two times (once for \[Needs the Money\] and once for \[Grumpy\]). So, the Difficulty Level goes from Moderate (10) to Severe (18).* |
| 4    | The player announces each modifier they have that lowers the Difficulty Level.                | Player: *My character has a pheromone implant, which lowers  the DL on Persuade rolls. So, that drops it back down from Severe (18) to Hard (14).*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5    | The player rolls and adds their character’s ability score.                                    | Player: *So, I roll a d20 and add my Presence score, which is 4. I rolled an 11. Adding 4, I have a result of 15.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 6    | Resolve the roll by comparing the result to the Difficulty Level.                             | Player: *I got a 15. The DL was Hard (14), so I succeeded! I get a free Cup-O-Kaffe!*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 7    | The GM affirms the resolution.                                                                | GM: *Rico looks at you and says, “You know, I don’t usually do this, but here." He hands you the Cup-O-Kaffe. "You look like you need it..”*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
