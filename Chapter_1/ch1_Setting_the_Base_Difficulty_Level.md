## Setting the Base Difficulty Level

Each skill action includes an entry for [[ch1_Difficulty_Level]] (DL), which determines how easy or difficult it is to execute. 

The DL used by a skill action can be based on one of the target's ***[[ch1_Traits|traits]]***, the skill action's ***[[ch1_Skill_Action_DL_Chart|DL chart]]***, or a ***[[ch3_Static_DL|static DL]]***.
