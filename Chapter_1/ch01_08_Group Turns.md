### Group Turns

When the group is partially or completely together in the same place at the same time, the GM is free to drop individual turns in favor of group turns. Group turns offer a loose, collaborative segment in which players share their ideas and narrate their character's actions without a formal turn order. This is a great time to let the players show off their characters' personalities and quirks, and it lets them roleplay with one another.

Group turns are especially useful when time is compressed or actions are routine, such as when traveling across the city, which could take a couple of hours or more. If players prefer to stay in the round robin turn order during group scenes, that is perfectly fine. Some players may want the opportunity to narrate what their character is doing during this moment of downtime.

Anyone not part of these group turns should still be given their individual turns, whether regular or combat.
