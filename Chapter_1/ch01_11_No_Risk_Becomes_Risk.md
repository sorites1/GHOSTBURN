It's important to realize that the same task can be performed automatically when there is no risk but requires a roll when there is. For example, climbing over a small fence is relatively easy to do but still requires some effort. All else being equal, a character could keep trying until they succeed; no need to roll. However, that same task requires a roll if we introduce risk. For example, a character is being chased and rounds the corner to see a small fence blocking their path. Now, if the character decides to go over the fence, the GM should have the player roll, even if the task is easy, because failure leads to consequences (the pursuers catch up).
