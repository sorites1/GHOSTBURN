Players should generally avoid interrupting other players on their turns. However, if one player narrates an action that would directly impact another player, the GM may allow the second player to react directly before returning to the first player. Any reaction by a second player should be minimal to preserve the first player's turn.

If you are unsure of what to do on your turn, the GM may also prompt you with a question or two to help you identify possible actions your character could take. However, you are not required to take an action on your turn. You may pass.
