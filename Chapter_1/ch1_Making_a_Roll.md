## Making a Roll

When the GM determines that a roll is necessary, they identify the skill and [[ch1_Abilities|ability score]] for the player to use, as well as the [[ch1_Difficulty_Level]] of the task. Difficulty Levels range from Automatic (2) to Extreme (22).

The player rolls a d20 and adds the appropriate ability score to get the result. 

If the result equals or exceeds the Difficulty Level, the character succeeds (and may have critically succeeded). If the result is less than the target number, the character fails (and may have critically failed).
