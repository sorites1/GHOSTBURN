### Traits

Some skill actions use an opponent's trait as the base Difficulty Level. For example, Persuade uses the target's Wits, and Ghost Trace uses the target system's Security trait.

**Traits** are only found in stat blocks for the opposition, never in player-characters, and they are expressed as Difficulty Levels. For example, Rico the food cart vendor has a Wits of Moderate (10), and the local Food Mart's payment system has a Security of Hard (14).
