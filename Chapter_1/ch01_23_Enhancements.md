## Enhancements

Weapons and gear often include (or can be modified to support) specific features that raise or lower the DL under specific circumstances. 

For example, a weapon with recoil compensation lowers the DL of all attacks made with it. Goggles or cyber eyes with low light vision balance the Difficulty Level of skill actions that would otherwise be made more difficult in low light. These effects, whether from a weapon, piece of gear, or cybernetic modification, are collectively known as enhancements.
