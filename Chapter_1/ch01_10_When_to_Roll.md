# When to Roll

When a player describes what their character is doing, the GM first determines if a roll is necessary. If the task is trivial, impossible, or carries no risk, such that a character could keep trying until they were successful, then it is not necessary to roll.

| Task       | Resolution              | Examples                       |
|:-----------|:------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Trivial    | You succeed             | Open a door<br>Make a phone call<br>Log on to the Net |
| Impossible | You cannot attempt      | Jump over a house<br>Run across water<br>Access cyberspace without jacking in |
| No Risk    | Keep trying until you succeed | Climb over a small fence<br>Navigate to an unfamiliar destination<br>Repair a piece of broken equipment |
