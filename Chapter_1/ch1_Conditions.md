### Conditions

Conditions are temporary effects on people codified by these rules. \[Off Guard\], \[Distracted\], and \[Hidden\] are examples of conditions that could affect your character. 

The entry for each condition includes its name, its causes, how it affects your character, and how to remove it. As with [[ch1_Qualities|qualities]], conditions can raise or lower [[ch1_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|Difficulty Levels]], but they usually have other effects as well.
