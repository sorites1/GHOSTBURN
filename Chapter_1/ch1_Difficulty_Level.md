## Difficulty Level

Each Difficulty Level (DL) includes a name and a number in parenthesis. When you use a skill action, you [[ch1_Making_a_Roll|roll]] a d20 and add the appropriate [[ch1_Ability Scores|ability score]]. Then you compare the result to the DL to determine success or failure. 

For example, Easy (6) means the action is easy to do and requires you to roll against a 6. If the result is a 6 or higher, your character succeeds.

There are six Difficulty Levels in this game: Automatic (2), Easy (6), Moderate (10), Hard (14), Severe (18), and Extreme (22).

| Attempting something... | Difficulty Level |
|:------------------------|:-----------------|
| Trivial                 | Automatic (2)    |
| Minor                   | Easy (6)         |
| Standard                | Moderate (10)    |
| Major                   | Hard (14)        |
| Massive                 | Severe (18)      |
| Monumental              | Extreme (22)     |

Before you roll, adjust the DL by applying relevant [[ch1_Conditions|conditions]], [[ch1_Qualities|qualities]], and enhancements.
