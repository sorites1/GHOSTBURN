## Your Turn

On your [[ch1_Turns|turn]], you tell the GM what you want your character to do. You can also ask questions of the GM or other players, whether their characters are with you or not. While in-game actions and dice rolls are shared openly, players are expected to keep their characters' knowledge separate. Just because you heard it, doesn't mean your character did.
