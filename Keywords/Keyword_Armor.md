# Armor

If you're wearing armor when you take damage from an \[Attack\], the damage is \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Reduced|Reduced]]\]. If your armor is rated against the \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Weapon_Group|Weapon Group]]\] used to make the \[Attack\], the damage is \[Reduced\] again. 

For example, say your character is wearing an Armor Vest, which is rated against Light Arms and Blades. If you are hit by an EZTech Punisher Lite (Light Arms) for its \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage|Normal Damage]]\] of 10, your armor causes the damage to be \[Reduced\] to its \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage|Minimum Damage]]\] of 5. Since your armor is rated against the Light Arms Weapon Group, the damage is \[Reduced\] again to \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Absolute_Damage|Absolute Damage]]\] of 1. If, on the other hand, you were hit by a Sterling Elite .45 (Heavy Arms) for its \[Normal Damage\] of 16, the damage would be reduced to its \[Minimum Damage\] of 8. Since your armor is not rated against Heavy Arms, the damage is not \[Reduced\] any further.
