# Armor

If you're wearing armor when you take damage from an \[Attack\], the damage is \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Reduced|Reduced]]\]. If your armor is rated against the \[[[Keyword_Weapon_Groups|Weapon Group]]\] used to make the \[Attack\], the damage is \[Reduced\] again.

For example, say your character is wearing Soft Armor, which is rated against \[Small Arms\]. 

You are hit by an [[Firearms/Firearms_LP_EZTech_Punisher_Lite|EZTech Punisher Lite]] (which is belongs to the \[Small Arms\] weapon group) for \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage|Normal Damage]]\] of 10, Since you are wearing armor, the damage is \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Reduced|Reduced]]\] to \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage|Minimum Damage]]\] of 5. Since your armor is rated against \[Small Arms\], the damage is \[Reduced\] again to \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Absolute_Damage|Absolute Damage]]\] of 1. 

On the other hand, when you are hit by a [[Firearms/Firearms_Rifle_Graham_PX90_Carbine|Graham PX-90 Carbine]] (Rifle) for \[Normal Damage\] of 18, the damage is \[Reduced\] to its \[Minimum Damage\] of 9. Since your armor is not rated against Rifles, the damage is not \[Reduced\] any further.
