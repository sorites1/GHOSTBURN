## Reduced

To determine \[Reduced\] damage, use the next worse value from the weapon's \[[[Damage Array|Damage Array]]\] compared to the damage generated by the outcome of the roll. \[Reduced\] damage cannot be lower than 1.

In other words, \[[[Keyword_Maximum_Damage|Maximum Damage]]\] is \[Reduced\] to \[[[Keyword_Normal_Damage|Normal Damage]]\], \[Normal Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to \[[[Keyword_Minimum_Damage|Minimum Damage]]\], and \[Minimum Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to \[[[Keyword_Absolute_Damage|Absolute Damage]]\].
