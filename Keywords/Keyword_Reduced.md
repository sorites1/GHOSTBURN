# Reduced

To determine \[Reduced\] damage, use the next worse value from the weapon's \[[[Gear/Gear_Damage_Array|Damage Array]]\] compared to the damage generated by the outcome of the roll. \[Reduced\] damage cannot be lower than 1.

In other words, \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Maximum_Damage|Maximum Damage]]\] is \[Reduced\] to \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage|Normal Damage]]\], \[Normal Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage|Minimum Damage]]\], and \[Minimum Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Absolute_Damage|Absolute Damage]]\].
