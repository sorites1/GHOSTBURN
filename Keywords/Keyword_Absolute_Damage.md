## Absolute Damage

\[Absolute Damage\] is 1 damage. This is the absolute lowest amount of damage any \[[[Keyword_Attack|Attack]]\] can deal where the player's \[Attack\] roll yielded a Fade, Success, or Cool Success before being \[[[Keyword_Downgraded|Downgraded]]\]. When \[Absolute Damage\] takes effect, it replaces the trick's normal Glitch outcome.
