## Optimal Range

A \[[[Keyword_Firearm|Firearm]]\] has an attribute called \[Optimal Range\]. A weapon's \[Optimal Range\] is one of the \[[[Keyword_Range|Range]]\] values: \[[[Keyword_Close|Close]]\], \[[[Keyword_Nearby|Nearby]]\], and \[[[Keyword_Far|Far]]\]. If you make an \[[[Keyword_Attack|Attack]]\] against a target at a \[Range\] other than the \[Optimal Range\], raise the DL by one for each range increment the target is away from the \[Optimal Range\]. For example, if your weapon has an \[Optimal Range\] of \[Far\], and you try to hit a target that is \[Nearby\], the DL is raised by one. To hit a target that is \[Close\] would mean the DL is raised by two.
