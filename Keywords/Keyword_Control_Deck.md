# Control Deck

A piece of hardware used to control drones and vehicles. 

To connect a \[Control Deck\] to a \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Drone|Drone]]\] or \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle|Vehicle]]\] so you can control it, you must have \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Admin|Admin]]\] access to it. You automatically have this access on any drone or vehicle you own. 

You may use a \[Control Deck\] to remotely control a \[Drone\] or \[Vehicle\] over \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Wireless|Wireless]]\]. This requires you to either wear a connected \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Control_Helmet|Control Helmet]]\] (included when you buy a \[Control Deck\]) or connect using the [[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Control_Port|Control Port]] augment.

Some vehicles have a \[Control Deck\] integrated into their onboard controls. Such a \[Vehicle\] allows you to \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Strap_In|Strap In]]\] if you have the \[Control Port\] augment.
