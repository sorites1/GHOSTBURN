# Improvised Trick

When these rules don't cover an action a player wants their character to perform, the GM can allow the player to make a roll and declare it an improvised trick. The GM is responsible for setting the Difficulty Level and determining the outcomes. The GM should feel free to work with the players to identify the outcomes, and they should be publicly shared with everyone at the table before the player makes their roll.
