# Mod

A \[Mod\] is a special feature that can be installed into a cybernetic augment. When a \[Mod\] is installed in an augment, do not apply the Mesh Cost to your character. 

For example, \[[[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_TGR_Claws|TGR Claws]]\] has a Mesh Cost of 4, which must be paid when the augment is installed in a \[Natural Arm\]. However, if it is installed in a \[[[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Arm|Cybernetic Arm]]\], you do not pay the Mesh Cost because it is being added as a \[Mod\].
