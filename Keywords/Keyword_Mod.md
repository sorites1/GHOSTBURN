# Mod

A \[Mod\] is a special feature that can be installed into a cybernetic augment. When you install a \[Mod\] into a cybernetic augment, you only pay the Mesh Cost of the Mod that exceeds the Mesh Cost of the cybernetic augment.  

For example, [[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_TGR_Claws|TGR Claws]] have a Mesh Cost of 4, which must be paid when the augment is installed normally. However, if TGR Claws are installed in a Mod Slot in a [[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Arm|Cybernetic Arm]], which has a Mesh Cost of 5, you pay 0 Mesh for the TGR Claws because its Mesh Cost does not exceed the Mesh Cost of the Cybernetic Arm.

Here's another example. [[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Glide_By_Wire_Reflexes|Glide-By-Wire Reflexes (Level 3)]] have a Mesh Cost of 12, which must be paid when the augment is installed normally. However, if that same augment is installed as a \[Mod\] in a [[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Spine|Cybernetic Spine (Level 1)]], which has a Mesh Cost of 5, then you only pay 7 Mesh for it (because its Mesh Cost of 12 is 7 more than the Mesh Cost of 5 for the Cybernetic Spine in which the \[Mod\] is being installed).
