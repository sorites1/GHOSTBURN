# Encrypted Package

An \[Encrypted Package\] is a data bundles that has been protected with encryption. You cannot access the data inside an \[Encrypted Package\] unless you have the key. A key could be a password, but it could also be a different kind of key, such as time key (where the data becomes accessible after a particular data and time), a visual key (where the data unlocks when you see a particular face, for example), or a location key (where the data unlocks only when you travel to a particular place).
