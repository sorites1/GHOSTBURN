# Handling

\[Handling\] represents how easy or difficult a A \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle|Vehicle]]\] or \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Drone|Drone]]\] is to control. \[Handling\] can have one of three values: Good, Average, and Bad. When you use Drive to make a precision maneuver with a \[Vehicle\] or \[Drone\], apply its \[Handling\] effect (if any). Good \[Handling\] lowers the DL by one level. Bad \[Handling\] raises the DL by one. Average \[Handling\] has no effect on the DL.
