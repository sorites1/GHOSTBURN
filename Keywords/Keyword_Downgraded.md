## Downgraded

When an outcome is \[Downgraded\], it moves down one level on the [[Outcomes]] chart. That is, a Cool Success becomes a Success, a Success becomes a Fade, and a Fade becomes a Glitch. A Glitch cannot be \[Downgraded\], but when determining damage, refer to \[[[Keyword_Absolute_Damage|Absolute Damage]]\].
