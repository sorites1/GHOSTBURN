# Friendly

When an NPC has an \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Attitude|Attitude]]\] of \[Friendly\] towards you, they are helpful and kind to you. When you use a \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Social|Social]]\] trick on a \[Friendly\] NPC, lower the DL by one.

If the target's \[Attitude\] is \[Friendly\], it cannot be improved. If something causes it to worsen, it drops to \[Neutral\].
