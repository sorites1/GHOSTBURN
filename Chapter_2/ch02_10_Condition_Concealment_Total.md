## Concealment, Total

**Cause:** Your entire body, including your gear, are totally concealed and cannot be seen by an observer. It is possible to have \[Concealment, Total\] to one observer and not another.

**Effect:** Attacks made against you by an observer to whom you have \[Concealment, Total\] have their D: raised by one. If the attacker's d20 roll (excluding ability score) is **odd** (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19) then the attacker's outcome is downgraded. Attempts made by the observer to locate you through sight alone automatically fail.

**Removal:** When you become fully visible to an observer or switch to having \[Concealment, Partial\] to them, you no longer have \[Concealment, Total\] to them.
