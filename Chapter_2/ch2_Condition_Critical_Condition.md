## Critical Condition

**Cause:** When you have sustained a \[[[ch2_Condition_Life_Threatening|Life Threatening]]\] injury and were subsequently \[[[ch2_Condition_Stabilized|Stabilized]]\] only to then fail your basic [[ch01_12_Abilities|Resilience]] roll at the start of a scene, you enter \[Critical Condition\]. You can also gain \[Critical Condition\] as the result of Surgery or Cybernetic Installation that ends in [[ch01_30_Critical_Failure|critical failure]].

**Effect:** At the end of each hour that passes, relative to you, make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Severe (18). If you [[ch01_27_Success|succeed]], you gain \[Stabilized\]. If you fail, make a mark. If you accumulate more marks than your Resilience score, you advance to \[Dying\].

**Removal:** When you gain \[[[ch2_Condition_Stabilized|Stabilized]]\], you lose \[Critical Condition\]. Any marks accumulated from failed basic Resilience rolls are reset to zero.
