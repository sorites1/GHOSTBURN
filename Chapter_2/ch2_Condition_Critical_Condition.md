## Critical Condition

**Cause:** When you have sustained a \[Life Threatening\] injury and were subsequently \[Stabilized\] only to then fail your basic Resilience roll at the start of a scene, you enter \[Critical Condition\]. You can also gain \[Critical Condition\] as the result of Surgery or Cybernetic Installation that ends in critical failure.

**Effect:** At the end of each hour that passes, relative to you, make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Severe (18). If you succeed, you gain \[Stabilized\]. If you fail, make a mark. If you fail more times than your Resilience score, you advance to \[Dying\].

**Removal:** When you become fully visible to an observer or switch to having \[[[ch2_Condition_Concealment_Partial|Partial Concealment]]\] to them, you no longer have \[Total Concealment\] to them.
