## Prone

**Cause:** When you lay down on the ground or are forced down by a condition or an attack, you gain \[Prone\].

**Effect:** \[Ranged\] attacks made against you, except Point Blank Shot, have their DL raised by one. \[Melee\] attacks made against you have their DL lowered by one. On your turn while \[Prone\], you may spend 1 AP to move, as if you were \[Movement Restricted\].

**Removal:** When you stand up, you lose the \[Prone\] condition.
