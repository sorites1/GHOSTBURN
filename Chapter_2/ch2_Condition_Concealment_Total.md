## Concealment, Total

**Cause:** Your entire body, including your gear, are totally concealed and cannot be seen by an observer. It is possible to have \[Total Concealment\] to one observer and not another.

**Effect:** Attacks made against you by an observer to whom you have \[Total Concealment\] have their [[ch1_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|DL raised by one]]. If the attacker's d20 roll (excluding ability score) is **odd** (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19) then the attacker's [[ch1_Outcomes|outcome]] is downgraded. Attempts made by the observer to locate you through sight alone automatically fail.

**Removal:** When you become fully visible to an observer or switch to having \[[[ch2_Condition_Concealment_Partial|Partial Concealment]]\] to them, you no longer have \[Total Concealment\] to them.
