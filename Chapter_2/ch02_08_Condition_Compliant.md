## Compliant

**Cause:** When a person or group is compelled to perform actions under duress, they gain the \[Compliant\] condition. This condition cannot be applied to player characters.

**Effect:** The Attitude of the \[Compliant\] person or group shifts to Hostile. They follow orders from the person (or people) they fear. They can be instructed to act against their own self-interests, but they will not put their loved ones at risk. They will not attempt to escape or retaliate as long as those they fear remain present.

**Removal:** Forcing someone to put their loved ones at risk causes them to \[Break\] and lose \[Compliant\]. If a \[Compliant\] person or group is left unattended for a few minutes, they automatically lose the \[Compliant\] condition..
