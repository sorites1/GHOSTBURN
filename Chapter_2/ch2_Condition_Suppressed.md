## Suppressed

**Cause:** When enemy gunfire pins you down, making it harder to move and retaliate, you are \[Suppressed\]. A single target can only have one instance of \[Suppressed\] at a time. Multiple applications of \[Suppressed\] on the same target do not stack.

**Effect:** You gain \[[[ch2_Condition_Movement_Impaired|Movement Impaired]]\]. When you make an attack, the DL is [[ch1_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|raised by]] one. 

**Removal:** At the end of your next [[ch1_Turns|turn]], you lose the \[Suppressed\] condition.
