## Muted

**Cause:** When a condition, effect, or injury prevents you from speaking, you are \[Muted\]. This condition replaces \[[[ch2_Condition_Speech_Impairment|Speech Impairment]]\].

**Effect:** You cannot speak, though you may be able to make grunts and other sounds. You cannot use skill actions with the \[Vocal\] keyword.

**Removal:** When the condition that caused you to be \[Muted\] is removed, you lose the \[Muted\] condition. If you gained \[Muted\] as the result of an injury, receiving Surgery or Cybernetic Installation, as described in the Recovery entry of the injury description. causes you to lose the \[Muted\] condition.
