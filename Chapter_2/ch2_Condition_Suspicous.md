## Suspicious

**Cause:** When you sense that someone may be lying, hiding something, or mispresenting the truth, you are \[Suspicious\]. This condition cannot be applied to player characters.

**Effect:** If you have a Friendly [[ch01_22_Attitude|Attitude]], it shifts to Neutral. Attempts to use Influence or Deception skill actions against you have their DL [[ch01_19_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|raised by]] one: If the person you are suspicious of  is using a Disguise or a Forgery, you may attempt to see through it.

**Removal:** If the subject of your suspicions raises your Attitude to Friendly, you lose \[Suspicious\].
