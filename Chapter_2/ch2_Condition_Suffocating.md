## Suffocating

**Cause:** When a condition or effect makes it almost impossible for you to breathe, you are \[Suffocating\]. 

**Effect:** At the start of your turn, take 1 damage. You get 2 AP on your turn (instead of 3 AP). Attack rolls and rolls to use Athletics, Driving, and Stealth skill actions have their DL [[ch01_19_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|raised by]] **two**. 

**Removal:** When the condition that caused you to be \[Suffocating\] is removed, you lose the \[Suffocating\] condition.
