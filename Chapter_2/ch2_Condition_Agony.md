## Agony

**Cause:** When a condition or injury causes you intense, unbearable pain, you are in \[Agony\].

**Effect:** All skill actions have their [[ch01_19_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|DL raised]] by **two**. Taking painkillers diminishes the effect of \[Agony\]. When you take painkillers, skill actions have their DL raised by one (instead of two).

**Removal:** When the condition that caused you to be in \[Agony\] is removed, you lose the \[Agony\] condition. If you are in \[Agony\] due to an injury, receiving Surgery or Cybernetic Installation, as described in the injury's Recovery entry, causes you to lose the \[Agony\] condition.
