## Prone

**Cause:** When you lay down on the ground or are forced down by a condition or an attack, you gain \[Prone\].

**Effect:** \[Ranged\] attacks made against you, except Point Blank Shot, have their DL [[ch1_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|raised by]] one. \[Melee\] attacks made against you have their DL [[ch1_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|lowered by]] one. On your turn while \[Prone\], you may spend 1 AP to [[ch3_Move|move]], as if you were \[[[ch2_Condition_Movement_Restricted|Movement Restricted]]\].

**Removal:** When you stand up, you lose the \[Prone\] condition.
