## Off Balance

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or effect makes it harder to keep your balance as you [[ch3_Move|move]], you are \[Off Balance\].

**Effect:** When you move, make a basic [[ch1_Abilities|Agility]] roll with a DL of Easy (6). If you fail, your move stops at the \[[[ch3_Half_Speed|Half-Speed]]\] point, and you fall \[[[ch2_Condition_Prone|Prone]]\].

**Removal:** When the condition that caused you to be \[Off Balance\] is removed, you lose the \[Off Balance\] condition.
