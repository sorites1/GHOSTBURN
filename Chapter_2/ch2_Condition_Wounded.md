## Wounded

**Cause:** When you are reduced to half your maximum [[ch3_Hit_Points|hit points]] (or less), you gain the \[Wounded\] condition.

**Effect:** All skill actions have their [[ch01_19_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|DL raised]] by one.

**Removal:** When you have more than half your maximum hit points, you lose the \[Wounded\] condition. You also lose the \[Wounded\] condition if you advance to \[Seriously Wounded\], \[Death's Door\], or \[Dying\].
