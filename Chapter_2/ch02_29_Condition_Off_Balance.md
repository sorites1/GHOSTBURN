## Off Balance

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or effect makes it harder to keep your balance as you move, you are \[Off Balance\].

**Effect:** When you move, make a basic Agility roll with a DL of Easy (6). If you fail, your move stops at the \[Half-Speed\] point, and you fall \[Prone\].

**Removal:** When the condition that caused you to be \[Off Balance\] is removed, you lose the \[Off Balance\] condition.
