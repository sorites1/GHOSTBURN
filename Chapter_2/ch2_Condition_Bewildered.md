## Bewildered

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or effect leaves you deeply and utterly confused, you are \[Bewildered\]. This replaces the \[[[ch2_Condition_Distracted|Distracted]]\] condition.

**Effect:** You are \[Unaware\].

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, you lose the \[Bewildered\] condition.
