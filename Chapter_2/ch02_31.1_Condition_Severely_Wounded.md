## Severely Wounded

**Cause:** When you are reduced to half your half of your Wounded value (or less) in hit points, you gain the \[Severely Wounded\] condition.

**Effect:** You gain \[Movement Impaired\]. All skill actions have their DL raised by one.

**Removal:** When you have more than half your Wounded value in hit points, you lose the \[Severely Wounded\] condition. You also lose the \[Severely Wounded\] condition if you advance to \[Death's Door\] or \[Dying\].
