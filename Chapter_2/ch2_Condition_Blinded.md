## Blinded

**Cause:** When an attack, condition, or environmental effect prevents you from seeing, you are \[Blinded\]. This condition replaces \[[[ch2_Condition_Vision_Impairment|Vision Impairment]]\].

**Effect:** You cannot see. All targets have \[[[ch2_Condition_Concealment_Total|Concealment, Total]]\] from you. \[Ranged\] attacks you make, except for Point Blank Shot, have their [[ch01_19_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|raised by]] by **two**. Point Blank Shot and \[Melee\] attacks you make have their DL raised by one. You gain \[[[ch2_Condition_Movement_Restricted|Movement Restricted]]\]. All other skill actions with the \[Visual\] keyword have their DL raised by **two** or may be impossible (GM's discretion).

**Removal:** When the condition or environmental effect that caused you to be \[Blinded\] is removed, you lose the \[Blinded\] condition. In rare cases, this condition is permanent.
