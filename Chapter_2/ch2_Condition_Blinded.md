## Blinded

**Cause:** When an attack, condition, or environmental effect prevents you from seeing, you are \[Blinded\].

**Effect:** You cannot see. All targets have \[Total Concealment\] from you. \[Ranged\] attacks you make, except for Point Blank Shot, have their DL raised by two. Point Blank Shot and \[Melee\] attacks you make have their DL raised by one. You gain \[Movement Restricted\]. 

**Removal:** When the condition or environmental effect that caused you to be \[Blinded\] is removed, you lose the \[Blinded\] condition. In rare cases, this condition is permanent.
