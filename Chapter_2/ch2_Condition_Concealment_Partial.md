## Concealment, Partial

**Cause:** You are partly concealed, making it harder for you to be seen by an observer. It is possible to have \[Concealment. Partial\] to one observer and not another.

**Effect:** Attacks made against you by an observer to whom you have \[Concealment, Partial\] have their [[ch01_19_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|raised by]] one. Attempts to locate you through sight alone have their DL raised by one.

**Removal:** When you become fully visible to an observer or switch to having \[[[ch2_Condition_Concealment_Total|Concealment, Total]]\] to them, you no longer have \[Concealment. Partial\] to them.
