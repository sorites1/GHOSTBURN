## Concealment, Partial

**Cause:** You are partly concealed, making it harder for you to be seen by an observer. It is possible to have \[Partial Concealment\] to one observer and not another.

**Effect:** Attacks made against you by an observer to whom you have \[Partial Concealment\] have their [[ch1_Adjusting_Difficulty_Level|DL raised by one]]. Attempts to locate you through sight alone have their DL raised by one.

**Removal:** When you become fully visible to an observer or switch to having \[[[ch2_Condition_Concealment_Total|Total Concealment]]\] to them, you no longer have \[Partial Concealment\] to them.
