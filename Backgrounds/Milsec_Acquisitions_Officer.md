#### Burns (Choose One)

**Caught Stealing** - Selling stolen weapons on the black market was quite lucrative until you were finally caught. Your superiors wanted to make an example of you, so you got the hell out and went to ground. You have a bounty on your head now. You're hunted. No company will touch you, so you seek out nontraditional employment to survive. 

**Defective Gear** - The substandard gear you'd procured on the cheap failed mid-mission, right when the bullets started to fly. You were the only survivor. You were fired from your job and held liable by the corporation for "loss of assets," leaving you with a massive debt you could never hope to repay. Worse is the guilt that still haunts you. You look for opportunities to earn trust, even if it's just to prove to yourself that you can be counted on.

**Secret Weapon** - You still don't know how that prototype ended up in the shipment you received, but it was clear that the higher ups wanted to keep it a secret when that hit squad showed up at your door. If only you'd been able to take it with you when you escaped, you might have some leverage. Instead, you escaped with your life, but you're not even sure how long that will last.
