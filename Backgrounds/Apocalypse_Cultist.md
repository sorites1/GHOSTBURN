#### Burns (Choose One)

**Operation Moon Bridge** - They poisoned themselves. You were supposed to do it too, but

**Milsec Mole** - You were betrayed. An undercover milsec agent infiltrated your circle of anarchs. Your friends are all dead now or captured, rotting behind bars or sentenced to hard labor in Spinebreak. The fact that you escaped is a testament to your survival instincts. Alone for the first time in years, you developed a new philosophy. Trust no one. Stay alive.

**Corporate Sponsor** - You were left reeling. The mysterious benefactor behind your activities was revealed to be a blood-sucking corporation. Everything you thought you'd accomplished turned to ashes in your mouth. You were a puppet, a cog in the machine you so deeply despised. Your idealism has been shattered, but you've vowed to make them pay. They will *all* pay.
