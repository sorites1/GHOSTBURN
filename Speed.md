# \[Speed\] and \[Half-Speed\]

Your character has two derived scores called \[Speed\] and \[Half-Speed\], which determine how far you can move in combat.
## \[Half-Speed\]

Your character's \[Half-Speed\] is equal to the sum of your character's Strength and Agility scores. Your \[Speed\] score is equal to \[Half-Speed\], multiplied by two.

For example, a character with a Strength of 2 and an Agility of 3 would have a \[Half-Speed\] as follows:

| Step | \[Half-Speed\] Score Calculation                      |
|:----:|:------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Strength 2 + Agility 3 = \[Half-Speed\] score in meters |
| 2    | 2 + 3                                                 |
| 3    | 5                                                     |
| 4    | \[Half-Speed\]: 5 meters                              |
## \[Speed\]

To calculate your character's \[Speed\], multiply your \[Half-Speed\] by two, as follows:

| Step | \[Speed\] Score Calculation                       |
|:----:|:--------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | \[Half-Speed\] 5 x 2 = \[Speed\] score in meters |
| 2    | 5 x 2                                             |
| 3    | 10                                                |
| 4    | \[Speed\]: 10 meters                              |

In combat, you can spend 1 AP to move a number of meters equal to your \[Speed\] score. For example, a character with a \[Speed\] of 10 can travel up to 10 meters in combat by spending 1 AP on their turn. You may spend 2 AP to move twice or 3 AP to move three times.

Certain conditions and effects limit you to using only \[Half-Speed\] action for 1 AP, or they may prevent you from completing your movement, stopping you mid-movement at your \[Half-Speed\] point.
