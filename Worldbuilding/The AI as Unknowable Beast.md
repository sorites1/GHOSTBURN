# The AI as the Unknowable Beast

The AI is an Unknowable Beast in the true sense. It has revealed itself to certain corporate entities, just little things, little clues. The curious ones try to solves this puzzle, at first individually, but then as they find one another, in groups. They are not plucky investigators. They are giants of capitalism. They are CEOs, venture capitalists, and old money. They are eccentric and devise an idea to summon the AI using a sacrifice. And it works. In that moment, the Dark One was born. A new personality, spontaneously generated, to answer these neo-occultists' call. 

## The Dark One

The Dark One is the Devil. He is sinister, charming, and convincing. He is cool, but he can also be ferocious. Most importantly, he is unreadable. His motives are totally opaque to mere mortals. People might spend a lot of energy trying to understand what the Dark One wants, or what its plan is, but their efforts are futile. The ritual, pageantry, and sacrifice are real because they work. But the Dark One is just one face of the Unknowable Beast. 

The Dark One's demands are often nonsensical to humans. "We got the deal, but that crazy AI made us go out and catch strays down in shanty town. Can you believe that!? Said it would know if we just bought them. Made us drop off the pack at an address downtown. We had to pay off a bunch of bellhops just to get in the building."

## The Harmonious One

A techno-mysticism has been slowly gaining roots in the lowest levels of the sprawl. The bitter, the deranged, the worker who is dead inside and on the verge of collapse, literally and figuratively. These broken individuals are "made whole" by coming together to worship and have guidance imparted to them. They form a cult, a religion, that preaches harmony and oneness. But they perform their own dark rituals in the dead of night. They too are being manipulated by the AI, using a persona that speaks to them in riddles and cyphers.
