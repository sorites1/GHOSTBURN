Spinebreak

About half of the land in what remains of North America is known as
Spinebreak. It borders the old Canadian border on the north, extends
down the western coast, and extends to the edge of a region that was
once known as the Great Plains. Spinebreak also push south to the old
Mexico-US border.

The Great Upheaval transformed the shape of the world, and Spinebreak is
no exception. The mountain range formerly known as the Rocky Mountains
was torn asunder, with the middle part being swallowed up by the Earth
itself. This gap in the mountains is now controlled by the Ceyenne
Citadel, which is perfectly positioned as the gateway to the West.

The terrain of Spinebreak is incredibly harsh, as rocky outcroppings
make travel difficult. The region is littered with naturally occurring
geysers that vent toxic gasses and boiling liquids up from Earth's
bowels, as the tectonic plates below the surface continue to slowly
grind into their new positions. This slow grind results in frequent, if
relatively minor, earthquakes in the region, a fact that is primarily
responsible for humans collectively deciding to avoid Spinebreak and
find a better place to live.

There is life in Spinebreak, however. Flora and fauna continue to
thrive, even under its harsh conditions, and some humans choose to
travel through or settle here for various reasons. Corporations still
value the minerals buried beneath the surface, and there are at least a
dozen mining operations in Spinebreak at any one time. Outlaws,
runaways, and others who want or need to leave their old lives behind
sometimes end up in Spinebreak too. It is one of the few places a person
can truly start over.

### Brokerock

Brokerock is the largest settlement in Spinebreak. Once known as Boise,
it now clings to the fractured western coast left behind by the Great
Upheaval. Little more than a shanty town, it's populated by a transient
mix of criminals lying low, victims with nowhere else to turn, and
corporate underlings sent to monitor or correct mining operations.
Still, a few long-term residents call Brokerock home, whether drawn by
its isolation or as a way to escape a world at war with itself.

## Phoenix Rise 

Against all odds, Phoenix Rise stands as a beacon of freedom and
high-tech accomplishments against a backdrop of the barren wastelands of
the Rocky Wastes.

## Desert of Salt 

The City of Salt Lake used to stand here. Now, the entire region is a
barren desert of salt. The region\'s transformation, which happened over
the course of a single year, is unexplained at this time. Mentions of a
connection with Cheyenne Citadel pop up every once in a while, on dark
intel channels.

## Cheyenne Citadel 

This city-state exists for and is protected by a military organization
that has its roots in the old United States. The old NORAD complex built
into the base of the Rocky Mountains is key to their operations. A
massive sprawl in its own right, Cheyenne Citadel has many sectors, all
of which are highly monitored and access to which is strictly
controlled.

## Deepcold 

Located in the northern part of the old U.S., Deepcold is not just cold
because of the naturally occurring climate. It\'s engineered that way
using good, ol' fashioned weather control. Rugged server farms,
semi-mobile racks that seek cooler climes, are monitored by data herders
who look out for stragglers and aim for 100% data integrity.

## Madchidet 

A portmanteau of Madison-Chicago-Detroit, Madchidet is referred to as
\"Mashee\" by the locals. \"Locals\" being a relative term. Madchidet is
bordered by the Great Lakes on the North and East. It borders the Frozen
Dark and the Breadboard and a little bit of Riverwrought on its West and
Southwest. And it opens in the Bay of (TBD) on the south.

## The Breadboard 

This flat expanse of grasslands is the heart of agriculture in New North
America. Farms dot the countryside along with their fields and
livestock. Simple folk they are, these people still make use of some mad
farming technology. And they have the ability to repair their own
tractors, even though they have to hack them to do it. Everyone does.

## Riverwrought 

A network of rivers and inlets, eddies and creeks, Riverwroght is a
spiderweb of water, and a rather large on at that. To the south,
Riverwrought borders Texnoplex. Riverwrought is responsible for cleaning
and distributing potable water to most civilized people in New North
America.

## Texnoplex 

Surprisingly small give its lineage, Texnoplex is a highly advanced,
ultra capitalist metroplex with a Texas flair. (I need to think about
this one more, I think.)

## Ridgeworld Sprawl 

A city of almost incomprehensible size, Ridgeworld Sprawl stands as a
testament to human ingenuity, engineering, and pride. It was the final
point of retreat, the place where humankind said to the oncoming water,
\"You shall rise no more.\" Built into the sides of the Appalachian
Mountains, Ridgeworld Sprawl is a city like no other. The Spine, the
very top of the mountain range, is home to some of the most exclusive
and expensive properties in the world. The farther down the mountain you
go, the farther below the poverty line you fall. The dregs of society,
the downtrodden and poor, exist at the bottom, working ever harder to
feed the machine.

## Atlanta Core 

A city-state unto itself, Atlanta Core exists fully inside the borders
of Ridgeworld Sprawl. Atlanta Core represents a carrying forward of
traditions and community. It embraces technology, music, art, and
nature, and the people who live there share a common belief that the key
to humanity is each other.

## Region: Old New England, The Shallows (Anneau Oui)

Once known as New England, the cradle of the American experiment, this
region is now a patchwork of shattered coastlines, sunken cities, and
wild hilltops. The tectonic chaos of the Great Upheaval caused the land
to fracture, sink, and be slowly consumed by the encroaching Atlantic.
Over 300 years, the area transformed into a broad, shallow sea broken by
rocky islands, half-drowned highlands, and flooded ruins.

To outsiders, it's *The Shallows*.

To the locals, many of whom can trace their lineage back to
French-speaking settlers who migrated here from Quebec, *Anneau Oui* is
its true name.

As the land disappeared underwater, so too did the old names. Some held
on to "New England," but in time, it became *Old* New England, and then,
eventually, just O.N.E. It was under this name that a new government was
born, led by Thomas Peabody, a man who believed himself to have a
singular vision, and who managed to convince those around him to
organize and rebuild.

What started as a reconstruction was quickly derailed by Peabody's
capricious whims. The people resented the new leadership for what they
said were the acts of a tyrant king. Those who criticized the fledgling
government flipped the lettering of the region's new name and began to
call it N.O.E, or New Old England, as an insult, an allusion to the old
kings of the past.

Years later, when migrants from Quebec arrived on these salty isles,
they were eager to join and help this community. By this time, the area
had been dubbed, *the Shallows*, by outsiders, the government still
referred to themselves as O.N.E., and the locals were still calling it
N.O.E. out of spite.

To these French-speaking people, however, N.O.E. was often misheard as
\"Anneau Oui.\" This linguistic turn took on meaning for those folk, and
many now refer to the area by that name. To them, it is a double entendre,
\"The Circle of Those Who Said Yes,\" a reference to the people who made
this their new home, and \"The Yes Ring,\" meaning, the loop of coastal
lands and adjoining archipelago, a \"ring\" created by the rising waters
of the Atlantic.

Today, Peabody's rule is all but forgotten. The people choose to
remember the name they gave to this place instead. Anneau Oui. A promise
whispered across the tides: *Yes, the circle remains*.
