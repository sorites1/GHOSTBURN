An **arcology** is a massive superstructure where tens of thousands of megacorp employees and their families live and work. According to common corporate practice, access to and from an arcology is strictly controlled to the point where most denizens spend their entire lives inside its walls. Schools, hospitals, shopping centers, restaurants, night clubs, adventure parks, and retirement facilities, everything one might expect to find in a city, is carefully curated, packaged, and delivered to the arcology's residents. From a young age, denizens are taught to believe in the spirit and power of the megacorp to which they belong and to not concern themselves with the outside world. Dreamers who wonder aloud what life might be like outside the walled garden are often selected for spirit training to reeducate and remind them of their debt to the company.
