Overcrowding is rampant, especially on the lower ridges of the city. **Box flats** are one solution that helps keep the problem in check. Rented out to single occupants, each box flat is the size of a coat closet and features such amenities as a cred-operated faucet, a drain, a vid-screen, and a bed. Cooking and all open flame is strictly prohibited inside a box flat. Also, guests are prohibited from entering a box flat; dual occupancy is not allowed. Box flats come in two varieties: vertical and horizontal. Many people prefer horizontal box flats because they are more conducive to sleeping, so they are in higher demand.
