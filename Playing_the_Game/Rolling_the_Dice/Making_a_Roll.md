# 2. Making a Roll

When the GM determines that a roll is necessary, follow the steps below. 

1. **Skill** - First, identify the skill to use based on what the character is trying to do. For example, use the Firearms skill to shoot a gun and the Athletics skill to make a running jump. If you have a bonus in the selected skill, it is added to your roll.
   
2. **Ability Score** - The skill determines the [[Abilities_and_Ability_Scores|ability score]] to use for the roll. For example, the Firearms skill uses Agility. You will add this ability score to your roll. 
   
3. **Trick** - Determine which of the skill's tricks to use. You can use any of the skill's [[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Core_Trick|core tricks]] or a [[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Signature_Trick|signature trick]] if you know one that applies. If you want to do something these rules don't cover, your GM may allow it as an [[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Improvised_Trick|improvised trick]].
   
4. **Difficulty Level** - The trick specifies the [[Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Difficulty_Level|Difficulty Level]] for the roll. The GM adjusts the Difficulty Level up or down, as described in [[Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Adjusting_the_Difficulty_Level|Adjusting the Difficulty Level]]. 
   
5. **Roll 2d10** - Roll 2d10 (two ten-sided dice) and sum them together. For example, if you rolled a 2 on one die and a 9 on the other die, you would have rolled 11.

6. **Ability Score and Skill Bonus** - Add the primary ability score based for the skill you're using. If you have a [[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Skill_Bonus|skill bonus]], add that too. For example, the Firearms skill is associated with Agility. If your character has an Agility score of 3 and a +1 skill bonus in Firearms, you would add +4 to your Firearms roll.

7. **Gear and Aug Bonuses** - If you have a [[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Gear_Bonus|gear bonus]] from a piece of equipment or an [[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Aug_Bonus|aug bonus]] from a cybernetic augmentation or psionic mutation, add those as well. For example, using a laser sight grants a +1 gear bonus to Firearms rolls. Bonuses of the same type do not stack, as described below.
   
8. **Result of the Roll** - The sum of your dice roll, plus your ability score and your bonuses is called the result. 
   
9. **Luck Bonus** - After you roll the dice and determine the result, you can spend a [[Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Luck_Points|Luck Point]] to add a [[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Luck_Bonus|Luck Bonus]] to the result. 
   
10. **Outcome** - Compare the result to the outcomes chart in the description of the trick you used to determine what happens.

### Stacking Bonuses

For any roll, you add at most one **ability score**, one **skill bonus**, one **gear bonus**, one **aug bonus**, and one **luck bonus**. You always add one ability score, but you might not have all (or any) of these bonuses.

Bonuses of the same type that target the same skill do not stack, and only the highest one applies. For example, if you have two pieces of gear that both give a gear bonus to Firearms, only the higher of the two bonuses is applied. 

### Substituting Ability Scores

Even though each skill has its own primary ability, the GM might decide to call for another ability to be used with a skill if it's appropriate. 

For example, asking the player to roll Strength with Intimidate when they try to literally strongarm someone into compliance, or having the player roll Drive with Intelligence to see if they know the kind of battery used in a specific model car.
