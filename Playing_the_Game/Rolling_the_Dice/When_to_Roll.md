# 1. When to Roll

When a player describes what their character is doing, the GM first determines if a roll is necessary. If the task is trivial, impossible, or carries no risk, such that a character could keep trying until they were successful, then it is not necessary to roll.

| Task       | Resolution              | Examples                       |
|:-----------|:------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Trivial    | You succeed             | Open a door<br>Make a phone call<br>Log on to the Net |
| Impossible | You cannot attempt      | Jump over a house<br>Run across water<br>Access cyberspace without jacking in |
| No Risk    | Keep trying until you succeed | Climb over a small fence<br>Navigate to an unfamiliar destination<br>Repair a piece of broken equipment |

It's important to realize that the same task can be performed automatically when there is no risk but requires a roll when there is. For example, climbing over a small fence is relatively easy to do but still requires some effort. All else being equal, a character could keep trying until they succeed; no need to roll. However, that same task requires a roll if we introduce risk. 

For example, a character is being chased and rounds the corner to see a small fence blocking their path. Now. if the character decides to go over the fence, the GM should have the player roll, even if the task is easy, Rolling low means the player might get a Fade, which introduces a complication, or a Glitch, which means they simply failed. In this example, failing to climb the fence means the pursuers get have a chance to catch up.
