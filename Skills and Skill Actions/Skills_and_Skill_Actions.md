# Skills and Skill Actions

There are ten skills in this game, two for each of the core five ability scores (Presence, Agility, Strength, Awareness, and Intelligence). Each skill contains three skill actions, which are specific applications of the skill. Refer to the rules for each skill action to learn how they work. 

### Skill Action Bonuses

Each skill action can have a bonus between +1 and +5. Add this bonus to the result, along with the appropriate ability score, when you make a roll. You can acquire a bonus to any skill action by purchasing it with XP, but those associated with favored skills are less expensive.

### You May Attempt Any Skill Action

You are allowed to use any skill actions, regardless of whether it belongs to a favored skill or has a bonus. For example, a character with only Melee as a favored skill and with only a +1 bonus to the Single Shot skill action can still make a roll to use the Persuade skill action under the Influence skill.
