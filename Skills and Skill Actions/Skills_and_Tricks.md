# Skills and Tricks

There are fifteen **skills** in this game, three for each of the core five ability scores (Presence, Awareness, Agility, Intelligence, and Strength). There are several **tricks** associated with each skill. 

## Skills

All skills are intended to apply broadly to the areas they effect, and though each skill has a primary ability score associated with it, the GM is encouraged to adopt new pairings as appropriate. For example, to see if a character knows the kind of battery used by a specific model car, the GM could call for a Drive roll and tell the player to use their Intelligence bonus. 

#### Outcomes Chart

To determine the outcome of a skill roll, compare the result of your roll to the Difficulty Level (DL) and then consult the chart below. The better the roll, the better the outcome.

| Outcome      | Roll Result                  | Description                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Glitch       | 2+ levels under the DL range | You fail to accomplish the task and suffer a complication |
| Fade         | 1 level under the DL range   | You accomplished the task but suffer a complication       |
| Success      | Hit the DL range             | You accomplished the task as intended                     |
| Cool Success | Over the DL range            | You accomplished the task and get an added benefit        |
#### GM Adjudication

This system calls on the GM to improvise complications and added benefits. As the player, you should also feel free to offer suggestions for what makes sense, but the GM is the final arbiter. 

### Core Actions

Some skills (like Medicine) contain core actions (like First Aid). A core action includes its own outcomes chart that tells you exactly how to interpret the results. This is done to provide a consistent and efficient play experience for certain situations, such as how to stabilize a friend who has just suffered a grievous injury in combat.

### You May Use Any Skill

You are allowed to use any skill and its core actions without penalty. Even if it's not a favored skill or have no bonus, you can still roll and add your ability score. 

### Skill Bonuses

Each skill action can have a bonus between +1 and +3. Add this bonus to the result, along with the appropriate ability score, when you make a roll. 

New characters start the game with a +1 bonus to a few skills. You can pick up a +1 bonus in a new skill or increase an existing bonus by +1 (up to +3) by spending 5 XP. 

For example, to go from no bonus (+0) to a +1 bonus costs 5 XP. To go from +1 to +2 costs another 5 XP. And to go from +2 to +3 costs another 5 XP. Thus, to go from +0 to +3, it costs 15 XP.

## Tricks

Tricks are specialized uses of your skills. Your character gets two tricks during character creation. 

Each trick is associated with a skill, and when you use a trick, you roll using that skill's bonus. Like core actions, tricks have their own mechanical outcomes. You should take the time to write your tricks and their details, including their outcomes, on your character sheet in the spaces provided. You can learn new tricks by purchasing them for 5 XP each, but you can only
