Pit Maneuver is an aggressive driving move designed to disable your opponent's vehicle and bring it to a stop. You maneuver your vehicle alongside so your front is lined up with the other vehicle's rear end. Then you use your vehicle to strike the rear quarter panel of the other vehicle with the intent of causing it to spin out and for the other driver to lose control.
