| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill    | Keywords                                                                                       |

*When you pick up your scalpel and enter the surgical theater, it is no exaggeration to say that you save lives.* 

Refer to the Injury Chart to determine the DL for treating an injury. If an injury can be treated with Surgery in the field, it will be included in the injury's description. If you perform Surgery in the field, drop the \[Location\] keyword and raise the DL by one. You cannot use Surgery on someone who is \[Traumatized\] or in \[Critical Condition\]. Those conditions must be removed before Surgery can be performed.

You may treat multiple injuries on the same target during the same surgical session, but you must roll separately for each one. It does not matter the order you treat them in. 

| Outcome      | Description                                          |

| Glitch       | They are \[Traumatized\] and takes 10 damage         |
