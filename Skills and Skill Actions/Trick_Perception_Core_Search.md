## Search \[Core Trick\]

| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill      | Keywords                           |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Hard (14)             | Perception | \[Move\], \[Physical\], \[Visual\] |

*You move about and study your surroundings for hidden people or objects.* 

When you use Search, define the scope of your search to the GM, such as *I want to search the desk* or *I want to scan the rooftops*. Then roll Search. If you are using your vision to Search, the task gains the \[Visual\] keyword. If you are using your hands to Search, it gains \[Physical\]. If your Search is wide-ranging, such as an entire house, it gains \[Move\].
