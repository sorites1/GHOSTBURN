## Keywords

Keywords act as requirements on skill actions or tell you which game elements raise or lower the Difficulty Level of a roll (though keywords themselves do not affect the DL). Some keywords, like \[Attack\] are merely tags that are referenced by other parts of the game.

The keywords used in this game are defined below.

| Keyword        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin          | You have \[Admin\] access to a device or system. You can perform all the same functions as an \[Operator\], but you also have full control and can make changes, such as performing a shutdown, locking out users, disabling alerts, modifying configurations, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Alert          | When a device or system detects an intruder, it issues an \[Alert\]. The \[Alert\] forcibly dumps the user that triggered the \[Alert\] and notifies the \[Admin\], as well as possibly locking down the system and reporting the user's location to the appropriate milsec personnel.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Attack         | An attack made against an opponent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Auditory       | You must be able to hear to use this skill or trick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Basic Roll     | When the rules call for you to make a \[Basic Roll\] they indicate the skill, ability score, and Difficulty Level to use for the roll, as well as the consequence for getting a Success or Failure. Unlike most rolls in the game, the \[Basic Roll\] has only two outcomes; Success and Failure.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Close          | Represents a very short distance between you and the target. The target is close enough to touch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Concentrate    | You must be able to focus to use this trick. Persistent loud noises, unpleasant smells, personal illness, and other odious effects raise the DL by one. If it is impossible to \[Concentrate\], the skill or trick cannot be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Control Deck   | A piece of hardware used to wireless control a device, such as a \[Drone\]. Often used in conjunction with a headset or \[Datajack\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Counterattack  | A special kind of \[Reaction\] triggered by some tricks and allows you to immediately \[Attack\] the opponent that triggered it even if it's not your turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Crashes        | When a \[Vehicle\] \[Crashes\] it collides with an immovable object and comes to a sudden stop. If the driver was wearing a safety belt, they take 2 damage. Otherwise, the driver suffers 25 points of damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Datajack       | A cybernetic implant used to directly interface with devices and systems, such as a \[Cyber Rig\] or \[Drone\]. When you are jacked in, you gain the \[Unaware\] condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Damage Array   | Damage for a weapon or an unarmed brawl attack is expressed as a damage array, which is a set of three numbers, separated by slashes, such as 5/10/25. These are the \[Minimum Damage], \[Normal Damage\], and \[Maximum Damage] values, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Disabled       | When a device, system feature, or cybernetic implant is \[Disabled\], it ceases to perform its function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Downgraded     | When an outcome is \[Downgraded\], it moves down one level on the outcomes chart. That is, a Cool Success becomes a Success, a Success becomes a Fade, and a Fade becomes a Glitch. A Glitch cannot be \[Downgraded\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Drone          | A drone, typically (though not necessarily) of the flying variety, which can be outfitted with video cameras and microphones for reconnaissance, weapons for combat, or even bombs for when precision matters more than the drone itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| One Hand       | You must use one hand to use this skill or trick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Operator       | You have \[Operator\] access to a device or system. You can perform basic functions as they are designed to be used, such as seeing through a video camera or changing the words and text on a digital sign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Opposed        | This trick uses an \[Opposed\] roll to determine the outcome instead of the standard resolution process. You roll normally, and the GM rolls 2d10 and adds the NPC's Threat bonus. Compare your result to the GM's result. If your result is 4 or more higher than the GM's roll, it's a Cool Success. If you get 1-3 higher than the GM's roll, it is a Success. If your result is equal to the GM's roll, it's a Fade. Lower than the GM's roll and it's a Glitch. |
| Physical       | When you use this skill action, you physically interact with the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Range          | This skill or trick is affected by range (\[Close\], \[Nearby\], \[Far\])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Reaction       | This trick is used in response to a trigger defined in its description. When the conditions for the trigger occur, you may use this trick even if it's not your turn. \[Reaction\] actions are free and do not have an AP cost. However, you can only use a number of \[Reaction\] actions each turn equal to your Agility score.                                                                                                                                    |
| Second Chance  | Roll again with the same DL. You must take the new result, except if you get a Fade, treat it as a Glitch. You may only take a \[Second Chance\] once. If \[Second Chance\] triggers again on this roll, ignore it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Security       | \[Security\] is a measure of how difficult a device or system is to hack. Retail is Easy (6), Small Corp Grade is Moderate (10), Middle Corp Grade is Hard (14), Megacorp Grade is Severe (18), and Milsec Grade is Extreme (22)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Setback        | You can only use this skill action on this target again if something changes, such as using a different tactic, providing (or learning) compelling new information, or approaching the situation as a compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
