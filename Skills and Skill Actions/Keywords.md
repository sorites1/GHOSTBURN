## Keywords

Keywords act as requirements on skill actions or tell you which game elements raise or lower the Difficulty Level of a roll (though keywords themselves do not affect the DL). Some keywords, like \[Attack\] are merely tags that are referenced by other parts of the game.

The keywords used in this game are defined below.

| Keyword            | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Admin              | You have \[Admin\] access to a device or system. You can perform all the same functions as an \[Operator\], but you also have full control and can make changes to the system or device, such as performing a system shutdown, locking out users, disabling alerts, modifying configurations, and so on. |
| Alert              | When a device or system detects an intruder, it issues an \[Alert\]. The \[Alert\] forcibly dumps the user that triggered the \[Alert\] and notifies the \[Admin\], as well as possibly locking down the system and reporting the user's location to the appropriate milsec personnel.                   |
| Attack             | An attack made against an opponent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Crashes            | When a \[Vehicle\] \[Crashes\] it collides with an immovable object and comes to a sudden stop. If the driver was wearing a safety belt, they take no damage. Otherwise, the driver suffers 25 points of damage.                                                                                         |
