## Keywords

Keywords act as requirements on skill actions or tell you which game elements raise or lower the Difficulty Level of a roll (though keywords themselves do not affect the DL). Some keywords, like \[Attack\] are merely tags that are referenced by other parts of the game.

The keywords used in this game are defined below.

| Keyword            | Type         | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
