## Favored Skills

Your character might have one or more **favored skills**. To indicate your character's favored skills, fill in the diamond symbol (◇) next to the skill name on your character sheet.

There are several benefits to having a favored skill. 

| Benefit           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Make a Reroll     | You can spend a luck point to reroll any skill action roll associated with a favored skill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Get a +1 Bonus    | When you roll for a skill action that belongs to a favored skill, you can spend a luck point to get a +1 bonus (before the roll). This bonus stacks with the other bonuses that are added to your roll.                                                                                                                     |
| Easier to Improve | It takes fewer XP to increase your bonus to skill actions associated with a favored skill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Acquisition Bonus | When you acquire a favored skill (either at character creation or by spending XP), you get a single +1 bonus which you can assign to any of the three skill actions associated with it. You can assign this bonus to a skill action that already has a bonus (effectively raising the bonus by one, up to a maximum of +5). |
