## Favored Skills

Favored Skills represent what your character is best at. You get two **favored skills** during character creation, one from your background and one of your choice. Once you play the game and gain Experience Points (XP), you may purchase additional favored skills for 10 XP each. To indicate your character's favored skills, fill in the diamond symbol (◇) next to the skill name on your character sheet. 

### Luck Points

For every two favored skills your character posses, you gain 1 Luck Point. Since you get two favored skills during character creation, you start the game with 1 Luck Point. (You can also gain Luck Points from having a high Intelligence score.) Once you have purchased two more favored skills, you will gain another Luck Point. 

#### Maximum Luck 

A character can only ever have 3 Luck Points. That is the maximum. Even if you have eight favored skills, you can have only 3 Luck Points. 

#### Using Luck Points

There are two ways to use Luck Points, and they can only be used with favored skills regardless of their source. Once you spend a Luck Point, it is gone for the rest of the game session.

| Get a +1 Bonus | Before you roll a favored skill, you can spend a Luck Point to get a +1 bonus to your roll. This bonus stacks with the other bonuses that are added to your roll. |
| Avoid a Glitch | If you roll a Glitch with a favored skill, you can spend a Luck Point to upgrade the outcome to a Fade.                                                           |

#### Getting Luck Points Back

Some specializations allow you to recover a Luck Point as part of a Cool Success. If you already have 3 Luck Points, you cannot recover any. 

At the start of each game session, your character recovers their Luck Points.
