*You connect your control deck to a drone over wireless and create a 3D Tactical Hologram (TDTH) using its cameras. Flying a drone is cognitively demanding and requires intense focus. To ensure they can concentrate, some pilots convert TDTH to VR and wear a headset to block out all potential distractions. Others go a step further and send the signal straight to their brains using a datajack.*

When you use Drone Piloting to perform a maneuver, state your desired outcome, such as *I want to fly up to the 38th floor and see if I can find the room we're looking for or I want to drop my drone's payload on the truck.* To use a drone's weapons array, use your character's Firearms skill rather than Drone Piloting. If you use a datajack, lower the DL by one.
