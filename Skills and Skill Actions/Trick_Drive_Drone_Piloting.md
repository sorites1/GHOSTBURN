## Drone Piloting \[Specialization\]

| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill | Keywords                                                                                                                            |

| Moderate (10)         | Drive | \[Concentrate\], \[Control Deck\], (\[Datajack\] and \[Unaware\]), \[Drone\], \[Physical\], \[Two Hands\], \[Visual\], \[Wireless\] |

You connect your \[Control Deck\] to a drone over \[Wireless\] and create a 3D Tactical Hologram (TDTH) using the drone's cameras. When you use Drone Piloting to perform a maneuver, state your desired outcome, such as *I want to fly up to the 38th floor and see if I can find the room we're looking for or I want to drop my drone's payload on the truck.* To use a drone's weapons array, use your character's Firearms skill rather than Drone Piloting.

To ensure they can \[Concentrate\] some pilots convert TDTH to VR and wear a headset to block out all potential distractions. Others go a step further and send the signal straight to their brains using a \[Datajack\], which makes them \[Unaware\] and lowers the DL by one.
