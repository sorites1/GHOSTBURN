| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill | Keywords                                                        |

| Wits                  | Brawl | \[Attack\], \[Unarmed\], \[Physical\], \[Two Hands\] \[Visual\] |

*You approach the enemy from behind and issue a series of rapid punches designed to interrupt the nervous system.* 

To use Silent Takedown, you must be \[Nearby\] your opponent and \[Undetected\] by them. For Silent Takedown to be effective, your target needs to be alone, else the second person will likely cry out or raise an alarm when they witness your attack.

Make a basic \[Stealth\] roll using their Wits as the DL. If you fail, you lose \[Undetected\], the opponent discovers you, and your action ends. Otherwise, you silently \[Move\] \[Close\] to them and roll Silent Takedown.
