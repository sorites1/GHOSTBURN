# 7. Finishing Touches

There are a few last things you need to do to finish creating your character.

## Luck Points 

You start the game with one [[Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Luck_Points|Luck Point]]. Write a 1 in the space labeled Luck Points on your character sheet. Later in the game, once you've earned XP, you can purchase up to two more Luck Points, for a maximum of three.

## Derived Characteristics

Your **Health Levels**, **Mesh**, and **Stabilization DL** are derived from your other ability scores.

### Health Levels

Your hit points are based on your Strength and Resilience scores. Calculate the hit points for your **Health Levels** as shown below. When a halving would result in a fraction, round up.

| Health Level             | Calculation                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Healthy (Max Hit Points) | (Strength + Resilience) x 5 |
| Wounded                  | Half of Healthy             |
| Severely Wounded         | Half of Wounded             |
| Death's Door             | Half of Severely Wounded    |

### Mesh

You have a derived attribute called **Mesh** which represents the limit on how much you can cybernetically augment your body.

| Derived Attribute | Calculation                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Mesh              | 10 + Strength score + Resilience score |

### Stabilization DL

When someone uses First Aid on you, they use your \[Stabilization DL\] to make you \[Stabilized\]. Your **\[Stabilization DL\]** is based on your Resilience score, as shown below.

| Resilience Score | Stabilization DL |
| :--------------: | :--------------- |
|        1         | Extreme (32)     |
|        2         | Severe (26)      |
|        3         | Hard (20)        |
|        4         | Moderate (14)    |
|        5         | Easy (8)         |

## Name

Last, don't forget to give your character a name and write it on your character sheet.
