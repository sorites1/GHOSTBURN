# NPCs

Non-Player Characters, or NPCs, are managed by the GM. They are contacts, enemies, and everyday people you might see on the street. 

## NPC Traits

NPCs have three traits: \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Wits|Wits]]\], \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Fort|Fort]]\], and \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Threat|Threat]]\]. 

\[Wits\] and \[Fort\] represent the NPC's smarts and toughness, respectively. They are each expressed as a \[[[Making_a_Roll/MaR_Difficulty_Level|Difficulty Level]]\] and come into play when a player uses a trick on the NPC. Want to [[Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Stealth_Core_Sneak|Sneak]] past a security guard? That targets the NPC's \[Wits\] to see if they notice you. Want to [[Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Insight_Dodge|Dodge]] the guard's punch? That targets their \[Fort\] to see if you can avoid their fist. 

\[Threat\] represents an NPC's overall competence and how much of a threat they pose. \[Threat\] is expressed as a bonus. When the GM rolls for the NPC, they add the NPC's \[Threat\] to get the result. \[Threat\] is used for all NPC rolls. 

## NPC Health Levels

NPCs have four Health Levels, as described below. 

An NPC's maximum hit points (Max HP) is equal to their \[Threat\] x 10. 

For example, an NPC with a Threat of +1 has 10 Max HP, whereas an NPC with a Threat of +5 has 50 Max HP.

| Health Levels | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uninjured     | An NPC who has taken no damage (and is at full hit points) is \[Uninjured\]. No penalties.                        |
| Fine          | An NPC who has lost hit points but currently has more than half their Max HP is \[Fine\]. No penalties.           |
| Hurt          | An NPC who has lost half or more of their Max HP is \[Hurt\]. NPC rolls have their DL raised by one.              |
| Defeated      | An NPC who has 10% or less of their Max HP is \[Defeated\]. The NPC is dead or nearly so; they cannot make rolls. |

## NPC Skills

NPCs have access to skills (and can have a bonus up to 3). As the GM, you are free to assign skills and bonuses to an NPC as you see fit. However, remember that, just like players, an NPC does not need a bonus to use a core trick and that a +1 represents Novice, +2 is Expert, and +3 is Professional. Some tricks cannot be used on player characters, which is noted in the trick's description if it applies. 

## NPC Gear

NPCs have access to gear, including [[Keywords/Keyword_Armor|Armor]], cybernetic augments, and weapons. However, NPCs only benefit from ability boosts granted by cyberware at half the rate and the bonus is added to Threat. For example, a cyberarm (Strength) 2 grants an NPC a +1 bonus to Threat.
