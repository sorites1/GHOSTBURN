# 6. Starting Package

Choose a starting package, or build your own. Starting characters get 30,000 ⌆ to spend on starting [[Gear_and_Augments/index|Gear and Augments]], which includes a starting [[Gear/Lifestyles|Lifestyle]]. If you do not purchase a Lifestyle, you start on the [[Gear/Lifestyle_Street|Street]]. Your starting package represents gear and augments you've accumulated over time or which you've recently obtained with the help of your medium. 

## Hacker 

*A hacker relies on their cyber rig to take on wireless devices they can see, but with a datajack, they can droptrip into the Foam Network and penetrate remote systems.*
