## Character Creation

In this game, each player creates a character to play. As the player, you make all the decisions about your character, including their background, natural abilities, skills, and so on. 

To create a character in ***GHOSTBURN 2325***, follow the steps below.

### 1. Background

Choose a background for your character. You can find a list of backgrounds in the next section. 

Your background describes who your character used to be and includes a culture, favored skill, and an additional benefit.
#### Background Name

Write the name of your background in the space labeled Background on your character sheet.
#### Culture

Your background gives you one Culture (Corporate, Milsec, Street, or Underworld). Write your culture in the space labeled Culture at the top of the character sheet.
#### Favored Skill

Your background gives you one favored skill. Fill in the diamond symbol (◇) next to the skill name on your character sheet to indicate it as a favored skill, and write +1 in its skill bonus box.

Later on in the game when you spend XP to improve your character, it costs fewer XP to improve favored skills and to purchase signature tricks associated with your favored skills as compared to non-favored skills. 
#### Additional Benefit

Your background also gives you an additional benefit which varies from one background to another. Your background may give you a Contact, Gear, Augment, Signature Trick, or a second Favored Skill. Write the additional benefit on your character sheet in the appropriate area. 

### 2. Burn and Hook

Choose a burn and a hook for your character. You can find a list of burns and hooks after the backgrounds in the next section. 

Your burn is a pivotal event in your life and helps explain why your character is no longer living the life described by their background. Your hook represents the lasting consequences of the burn. 

Your background, burn, and hook should all tie together to show your character's story, like this: 

*I am a **\[Background\]** who was **\[Burned\]**, and now I am **\[Hook\]**.*

For example: 

*I am a **\[Street Vendor\]** who was **\[Witness\]** to a murder, and now I'm being **\[Hunted\]** by the megacorp that wants to silence me.*

Write your burn and hook at the top of your character sheet in the spaces labeled Burn and Hook, respectively.

### 3. Contacts

A contact is someone you personally know and with whom you are on good terms. You can call on your contacts periodically to see if they can help you. Contacts can provide information, goods or services, or even a place to sleep. You start the game with two contacts.

**Medium** - Your medium is the person who "discovered" you after you got burned. They used their power and connections to erase your digital identity on the Net, turning you into a **ghost**, someone who no longer exists in any database. They also put you together with the other ghosts in your crew. The GM will use your medium to offer you jobs, give you access to black market goods and services, and assist with other things you might need. The GM will tell you the medium's name so you can write it down on your character sheet.

**Choose a Contact** - Choose a contact that has the same culture as you. This person might be connected to your old life, they may have helped you when you got burned, or perhaps they even introduced you to your medium. Feel free to come up with a name and a few details about your contact. Write them down on your character sheet and share them with the GM. 

### 4. Ability Scores

A character's ability scores reflect their natural abilities, such as their strength and intelligence. 

| Ability Name | Description                                                  |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presence     | Force of personality, social awareness, and artistic ability |
| Awareness    | Physical senses, insight, and abstract thinking              |
| Agility      | Quickness, nimbleness, balance, and coordination             |
| Intelligence | Education, reasoning, quick thinking, and general knowledge  |
| Strength     | Physical strength and general athleticism                    |
| Resilience   | Bodily fortitude, health, and willpower                      |
| Psi          | Raw psionic talent                                           |

The higher the score, the greater the ability. Natural ability scores range from 1 to 5, as shown below. 

| Ability Score | Ability Level | Description                                       |
| :-----------: | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
|       1       | Weak          | Underdeveloped, marginally capable                |
|       2       | Below Average | Less capable than most, often struggles           |
|       3       | Average       | Human average, sufficient for most things in life |
|       4       | Exceptional   | Better than most, a serious contender             |
|       5       | Peak Human    | The best of the best                              |

You get **17 points** to distribute between your abilities. Only one ability score can be set to 5 at character creation. The rest must be 4 or less. 

If you want your character to be psionic, you must have a Psi score of 1 (the maximum at character creation). Otherwise, leave Psi at 0. This is the only ability score that can be 0. 

| Example Character (No Psionics)                                                                 | Example Character (With Psionics)                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presence 1<br>Agility 5<br>Strength 4<br>Awareness 2<br>Intelligence 2<br>Resilience 3<br>Psi 0 | Presence 3<br>Agility 3<br>Strength 1<br>Awareness 3<br>Intelligence 2<br>Resilience 4<br>Psi 1 |

### 5. Additional Skills

Choose three skills, and write +1 in the skill bonus box for each. No skill may have a skill bonus be higher than +1 at the start of the game.

You do not start the game with signature tricks in these skills, but you can purchase them later in the game once you have earned XP. 

### 6. Starting Resources

You get **10 points** to spend on the cybernetic augmentations, gear, and lifestyle. The point cost for each item is shown below. If you do not purchase a lifestyle, your character gets the Street lifestyle at no cost.

#### Melee Weapons

TBD


#### Armor

When you are wearing armor and are hit by an \[Attack\], the outcome is \[Downgraded\]. If your armor is rated against the weapon type used to make the \[Attack\], the outcome is \[Downgraded\] a second time. 

For example, you are wearing a light vest when you are hit by an \[Attack\] made with a light pistol. Because you are wearing armor, the outcome is \[Downgraded\], and since your light vest is rated against light pistols, the damage outcome is \[Downgraded\] again.

## 7. Finishing Touches

There are a few last things you need to do to finish creating your character.

### Luck Points 

You start the game with one [[Luck_Points|Luck Point]]. Write a 1 in the space labeled Luck Points on your character sheet. Later in the game, once you've earned XP, you can purchase up to two more Luck Points, for a maximum of three.

### Derived Characteristics

Your **Health Levels**, **Mesh Capacity**, and **Stabilization DL** are derived from your other ability scores.

#### Health Levels

Your hit points are based on your Strength and Resilience scores. Calculate the hit points for your **Health Levels** as shown below. When a halving would result in a fraction, round up.

| Health Level             | Calculation                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Healthy (Max Hit Points) | (Strength + Resilience) x 5 |
| Wounded                  | Half of Healthy             |
| Severely Wounded         | Half of Wounded             |
| Death's Door             | Half of Severely Wounded    |
#### Mesh

You have a derived attribute called **Mesh** which represents the limit on how much you can cybernetically augment your body.

| Derived Attribute | Calculation                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Mesh              | 10 + Strength score + Resilience score |
#### Stabilization DL

When someone uses First Aid on you, they use your \[Stabilization DL\] to make you \[Stabilized\]. Your **\[Stabilization DL\]** is based on your Resilience score, as shown below.

| Resilience Score | Stabilization DL |
| :--------------: | :--------------- |
|        1         | Extreme (32)     |
|        2         | Severe (26)      |
|        3         | Hard (20)        |

|        5         | Easy (8)         |
### Name

Last, don't forget to give your character a name and write it on your character sheet.
