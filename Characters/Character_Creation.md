## Character Creation

In this game, each player creates a character to play. As the player, you make all the decisions about your character, including their background, natural abilities, skills, and so on. 

To create a character in ***GHOSTBURN 2325***, follow the steps below.

### 1. Ability Scores

A character's ability scores describe their natural abilities, such as their strength and intelligence. The higher the score, the greater the ability. Scores range from 0 to 5. Ability scores (except Resilience and Psi) can be increased beyond the natural limit of 5 through cybernetic augmentation.

| Ability Score | Ability Level | Description                                       |
| :-----------: | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
|       0       | Incapable     | Totally non-functional, disabled                  |
|       1       | Feeble        | Barely capable, like a small child                |
|       2       | Average       | Human average, sufficient for most things in life |
|       3       | Impressive    | A step up from most people, competent and capable |
|       4       | Exceptional   | Better than most, a serious contender             |
|       5       | Peak Human    | The best of the best                              |

Your character has six ability scores (or seven, if you want your character to have psionic powers). 

| Ability Name | Description                                                  | Associated Skills       | Additional Impacts                                              |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presence     | Force of personality, social awareness, and artistic ability | Influence and Deception |                                                                 |
| Agility      | Quickness, nimbleness, balance, and coordination             | Firearms and Stealth    |                                                                 |
| Strength     | Physical strength and general athleticism                    | Melee and Athletics     | Hit Points                                                      |
| Awareness    | Physical senses, insight, abstract thinking                  | Perception and Insight  |                                                                 |
| Intelligence | Education, reasoning, quick thinking, and general knowledge  | Medicine and Tech       | Action Points and extra Luck Points                             |
| Resilience   | Bodily fortitude, health, and willpower                      | -                       | Mesh Capacity, Hit Points, Stabilization DL, and Wound Recovery |
| Psi          | Raw psionic talent                                           | -                       | Affects psionic powers                                          |

You get **17 points** to distribute between your abilities. Each ability score must be at least 1 (except for Psi, which can remain at 0). Only one ability score can be set to 5. If you want your character to have psionic powers, you must have a Psi of 1 (or higher).

You will be given the opportunity to raise your ability scores later, once you have played and earned XP. If you start the game with a Psi of 1 or higher, you can raise your Psi score later (up to a maximum of 5), but if you start the game with a Psi of 0, you cannot purchase it. 

**Example Mundane Character**

Presence 1
Agility 5
Strength 4
Awareness 2
Intelligence 2
Resilience 3
Psi 0

**Example Psionic Character**

Presence 2
Agility 2
Strength 1
Awareness 2
Intelligence 2
Resilience 3
Psi 5

### 2. Choose a Background

Choose a background for your character. You can find a list of backgrounds and their benefits in the next section. Your background describes who your character used to be before they got burned and became a ghost. 

Each background gives you one culture and a few benefits, which you should note on your character sheet. The types of benefits you can get from a background include: Favored Skill, +1 Bonus to a Skill Action, +1 Bonus to a Specialization, Specific Cyberware, Cyberware Package, and Psionic Powers.

#### Favored Skill

Indicate your favored skills by filling in the diamond symbol  (◇) next to the skill name on your character sheet. Later on in the game when you spend XP to improve your character, it costs less to improve the skill actions associated with favored skills than it does to increase skill actions for non-favored skills. 

#### +1 Bonus to a Skill Action

Write +1 in the parenthesis next to the name of the skill action on your character sheet.

#### +1 Bonus to a Specialization

Write the name of the specialization in the appropriate column on your character. Then write +1 in the parenthesis next to the name. 

#### Specific Cyberware

Some backgrounds give you a key piece of cyberware. Write the item down on your character sheet.

#### Cyberware Package ####

Choose one of the cyberware packages shown below and write each item on your character sheet. Also write the adjusted ability score in the space labeled \[AUG\].

### Hook

| Hook            | Description                                                                                       |

### Contacts

You start the game with two contacts.

**Fixer** - Your first contact is the crew's fixer, an NPC used by the GM to offer you jobs throughout the campaign. Your fixer is the one who "discovered" you and put you together with the other ghosts in your crew. The GM will tell you the fixer's name so you can write it down on your character sheet.

**Choose a Contact** - Choose another contact from the list of backgrounds that has the same culture you got from your background. This person helped you when you got burned and may have been the one to introduce you to your crew's  fixer. Feel free to come up with a name and a few details about your contact and share them with the GM. 

## 4. Choose a Favored Skill

Choose a favored skill and indicate it on your character sheet by filling in the diamond symbol (◇) next to the skill name on your character sheet. This is in addition to any favored skill(s) you received as part of your background. 

For your reference, the skills are Influence, Deception, Firearms, Stealth, Melee, Athletics, Perception, Insight, Medicine, and Tech.

## 5. Distribute Skill Action Bonuses

You get a number of +1 skill action bonuses equal to your Intelligence score. For example, if your character's Intelligence is 2, then you get two +1 skill action bonuses to distribute. This is in addition to any skill action bonuses you received as part of your background.

You may put your +1 bonuses in any skill action shown in the Skills section of your character sheet (regardless of whether it is a favored skill or not), but you cannot stack the bonuses during character creation. That is, a +1 bonus is the most you can have for any skill action at the start of the game. 

## 6. Finishing Touches

There are a few last things you need to do to finish creating your character.

### Action Points and Luck Points

Every character gets one **luck point** which can be used once per session to alter the course of the game. Characters with high Intelligence scores get additional luck points.

You also get a number of **action points** to use each time it's your turn in combat. The more action points you have, the more you can do each turn. Your action points are also based on your character's Intelligence score. 

| Intelligence Score | Benefit                                   |
| :----------------: | ----------------------------------------- |
|         1          | 1 action point                            |
|         2          | 2 action points                           |
|         3          | 3 action points                           |
|         4          | 3 action points and one extra luck point  |
|         5+         | 3 action points and two extra luck points |

### Mesh Capacity

You have an attribute called **Mesh Capacity** which represents the limit on how much cyberware you can cram in your body.

| Derived Ability Score | Calculation                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Mesh Capacity         | 10 + Strength score + Resilience score |

### Health Levels

Your hit points are based on your Strength and Resilience scores. Calculate the hit points for your health levels as shown below. When a halving would result in a fraction, round up.

| Health Level             | Calculation                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Healthy (Max Hit Points) | (Strength + Resilience) x 5 |
| Wounded                  | Half of Healthy             |
| Severely Wounded         | Half of Wounded             |
| Death's Door             | Half of Severely Wounded    |

### Cyberware and Gear (or Bonuses)

You get 25,000 cred to spend on your character during character creation. You can use this money to buy equipment, weapons, cyberware, drones, and vehicles. It's important to understand that this is not cash your character possesses, but rather an approximation for the resources they have accumulated over time. 

In addition, you can exchange cred during character creation for skill action bonuses. For every 10,000 cred you spend, you can purchase a +1 bonus to apply to one of the skill actions on your character sheet. You cannot apply this to a skill action that already has a +1 bonus. 


| Weapon               | Type     | Mode        | Damage Array   |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Remington Firewalker | Revolver | Single Shot | 6/8/10/12/14   |
| AR-99                | Assault  | Single Shot | 6/10/14/18/20  |
| AR-99                | Assault  | Burst       | 10/16/22/28/34 |
| Uzi Mark IV          | SMG      | Single Shot | 4/8/12/16/20   |
| Uzi Mark IV          | SMG      | Burst       | 8/12/16/20/24  |

### Low Lifestyle

Last, write down Low Lifestyle on your character in the designated area. All characters begin the game with Low Lifestyle.
