You pay for a box flat, a single occupancy room the size of a coat closet (both horizontal and vertical configurations are available). A box flat includes a cred-operated faucet, a floor drain, a vid-screen, and a bed. Cooking and open flame are strictly prohibited. Communal, cred-op showers are available, though not always operational. In Ridgeworld, you live in one of hundreds of box flat residential towers built along the lower ridge.
