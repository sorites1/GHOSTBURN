# Abilities

Abilities represent a character's natural, untrained state, their raw potential. Each character is composed of the following abilities:

| **Ability**  | **Description**                                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presence     | A combination of raw magnetism, artistic talent, and social insight    |
| Agility      | Reflects a character's quickness, reaction speed, and manual dexterity |
| Strength     | A measure of a character's physical form and raw strength              |
| Awareness    | Represents a character's senses and insights                           |
| Intelligence | Indicates a character's education and critical thinking                |
| Resilience   | Mental and physical fortitude; resist injury and psychic burn          |
| Psi          | Represents a character's raw psionic ability                           |

# Ability Scores

Each of your abilities has a number associated with it called an ability score. An ability score has a natural range of 1 to 5. Cybernetic augmentations and psionic mutations can increase your ability score (up to +3), for a maximum augmented ability score of 8. Each of your ability scores must be at least 1, except for Psi, which is 0 if you are not playing a psionic character.

| Ability Score | Ability Level | Description                                         |
| :-----------: | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- |
|       0       | Incapable     | Completely incapable, non-functional                |
|       1       | Weak          | Underdeveloped, marginally capable                  |
|       2       | Below Average | Less capable than most, often struggles             |
|       3       | Average       | Human average, sufficient for most things in life   |
|       4       | Exceptional   | Better than most, a serious contender               |
|       5       | Peak Human    | The best of the best humankind has to offer         |
|       6       | Beyond Human  | Exceeds natural human limits                        |
|       7       | Superhuman    | Awe inspiring, breathtaking                         |
|       8       | Extraordinary | Nearing limits of the animal kingdom, apex predator |

Note: Ability scores above 8 are beyond player character capabilities and are provided to the GM to use as a basis for powerful enemies, such as constructs, and to show theoretical limits.

| Ability Score | Ability Level | Description                                          |
