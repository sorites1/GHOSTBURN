## NPCs

Non-Player Characters, or NPCs, are managed by the GM. They are contacts, enemies, and everyday people you might see on the street. 

### NPC Traits

NPCs have three traits: Wits, Fort, and Threat.

| Trait    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attitude | Represents how an NPC feels about a particular person. Attitude can be thought of as a spectrum with three values: Friendly, Neutral, and Hostile. A Friendly NPC is helpful and kind to you. When you use a \[Social\] skill or trick on a Friendly NPC, lower the DL by one. A Neutral NPC is ambivalent towards you, but is willing to do business and will engage in small talk. A Hostile NPC is discourteous and unkind to you. When you use a \[Social\] skill or trick on a Hostile NPC, raise the DL by one. |
| Wits     | This trait represents an NPC's intelligence, knowledge, and social skills. \[Wits\] is expressed as a Difficulty Level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Fort     | This trait represents an NPC's fortitude, toughness, and strength. \[Fort\] is expressed as a Difficulty Level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Threat   | This trait has a natural range from +1 to +5 and represents an NPC's overall combat capability. Cyberware can increase this bonus beyond +5. The GM adds the \[Threat\] bonus to rolls made for an NPC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Max HP   | An NPC's maximum hit points are equal to their \[Threat\] x 10. For example, an NPC with a Threat of +1 has 10 max hp, whereas an NPC with a Threat of +5 has 50 max hp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Fine     | An NPC who has more hit points than their \[Hurt\] value is \[Fine\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Hurt     | This trait is equal to the NPC's Max Hit Points divided by 2. For example, an NPC with 10 hp has a \[Hurting\] value of 5 hp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Hurting  | An NPC who has hit points equal to or less than their \[Hurt\] value is \[Hurting\]. When an NPC is \[Hurting\], skills and tricks they use have their DL raised by one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### NPC Skills

NPCs have access to skills (and can have a bonus up to 3). As the GM, you are free to assign skills and bonuses to an NPC as you see fit. However, remember that, just like players, an NPC does not need a bonus to use a core trick and that a +1 represents Novice, +2 is Expert, and +3 is Professional. 

### NPC Gear

NPCs have access to gear, including armor, cyberware and weapons. However, NPCs benefit from ability boosts granted by cyberware at half the rate and the bonus is added to Threat. For example, a cyberarm (Strength) 2 grants an NPC a +1 bonus to Threat.
