## Reliable

**Cause:** When you achieve a Major (14) Success or a Severe (18) Success on certain skill actions, a \[Compliant\] target becomes \[Reliable]\. 

**Effect:** Even if you leave the \[Vicinity\] for more than one turn, the target does not lose \[Compliant\] and will remain in the same location when told to stay put.

**Removal:** When the target loses \[Compliant\], they also lose \[Reliable\]..
