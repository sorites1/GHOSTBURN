## Off Balance

**Cause:** When a trick, condition, or effect makes it harder to stay on your feet, you are \[Off Balance\].

**Effect:** When you are \[Off Balance\] and attempt to \[[[Keyword_Move|Move]]\] or use a trick with the \[[[Keyword_Physical|Physical]]\] keyword, make a basic Athletics roll with a DL of Easy (8). If you fail, you do not perform the action and immediately fall \[[[Condition_Prone|Prone]]\].

**Removal:** If a lasting condition is the cause of \[Off Balance\], then you lose \[Off Balance\] when you lose that condition. Otherwise, you lose \[Off Balance\] at the start of your turn.
