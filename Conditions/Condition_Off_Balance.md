## Off Balance

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or effect makes it harder to stay on your feet, you are \[Off Balance\].

**Effect:** When you are \[Off Balance\] and attempt to \[Move\] or use a skill or trick with the \[Physical\] keyword, make a basic Athletics roll with a DL of Easy (6). If you fail, you do not perform the action and immediately fall \[Prone\].

**Removal:** If a lasting condition is the cause of \[Off Balance\], then you lose \[Off Balance\] when you lose that condition. Otherwise, you lose \[Off Balance\] at the start of your turn.
