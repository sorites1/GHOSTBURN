## Stress

**Cause:** \[Stress\] is triggered by getting a Fade on certain tricks.

**Effect:** At the start of your turn, make a \[Basic Roll\] using the same trick that you were using when you triggered \[Stress\]. Use the DL identified in the \[Stress\] description. Failure means you trigger the Glitch outcome of that trick.

**Removal:** You lose the \[Stress\] condition if you fail the \[Basic Roll\] and trigger a Glitch. If you use an action point to reroll the trick and get a Success or Cool Success, you lose the \[Stress\] condition. When the scene ends, you lose the \[Stress\] condition.
