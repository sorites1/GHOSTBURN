## Stress

**Cause:** \[Stress\] is triggered by getting a Fade on a specialization roll.

**Effect:** At the start of your turn, make a \[Basic Roll\] using the same specialization that you were using when you triggered \[Stress\]. Use the DL identified in the \[Stress\] description. Failure means you trigger the Glitch outcome of that specialization.

**Removal:** You lose the \[Stress\] condition if you fail the \[Basic Roll\] and trigger a Glitch, use an action to roll the specialization again get a Success or Cool Success, or the scene ends.
