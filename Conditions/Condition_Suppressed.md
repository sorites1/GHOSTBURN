# Suppressed

**Cause:** When enemy gunfire pins you down, making it harder to move and retaliate, you are \[Suppressed\]. A single target can only have one instance of \[Suppressed\] at a time. Multiple applications of \[Suppressed\] on the same target do not stack.

**Effect:** You gain \[[[Conditions/Condition_Movement_Impaired|Movement Impaired]]\]. When you make an \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Attack|Attack]]\], the DL is raised by one. 

**Removal:** At the end of your next turn, you lose the \[Suppressed\] condition.
