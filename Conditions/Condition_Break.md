## Break

**Cause:** When a a person or situation pushes you to your limits, you \[Break\] and can no longer control your actions.

**Effect:** You attack, flee, or break down on the spot. If you attack, you target what you perceive to be the source of your ire, which could be a person, place, or thing. If you flee, you attempt to escape that perceived source. If you break down, you fall \[Prone\] and pour out your emotions. If a group is caused to \[Break\], individuals from the group represent all three reactions. If a character caused the target to break, the target's \[Attitude\] towards that character drops to Hostile. If the target is \[Compliant\] when they \[Break\], they lose \[Compliant\].

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Hard (14). Success means you regain control and lose the \[Break\] condition. For NPCs, the GM should make a Threat roll using the NPC's Fort as the DL.
