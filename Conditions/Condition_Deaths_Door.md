# Death's Door

**Cause:** When you are reduced to half your Severely Wounded value (or less) in hit points, you gain the \[Death's Door\] condition. This condition follows and replaces \[[[Conditions/Condition_Wounded|Wounded]]\] and \[[[Conditions/Condition_Severely_Wounded|Severely Wounded]]\].

**Effect:** You gain \[[[Conditions/Condition_Movement_Restricted|Movement Restricted]]\]. You are \[[[Conditions/Condition_Prone|Prone]]\]. All skill actions have their DL raised by one. The first time you gain \[Death's Door\] during a scene, roll on the Injury Level Chart; see \[[[Health_and_Healing/HaH_Sustaining_an_Injury|Sustaining an Injury]]\].

**Removal:** When you have more than half of your Severely Wounded hit points, you lose the \[Death's Door\] condition. You also lose the \[Death's Door\] condition if you advance to \[[[Conditions/Condition_Dying|Dying]]\].
