## Drowning

**Cause:** When you are underwater and unable to breathe or hold your breathe, you are \[Drowning\]. If you are swimming and become \[Unconscious\], you automatically begin \[Drowning\]. If you are forced to go \[Prone\] while swimming, you begin \[Drowning\].

**Effect:** You lose \[Prone\] and gain \[Movement Restricted\] and \[Off Guard\]. All skills and tricks have their DL raised by one. At the start of your turn, take 5 damage and make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Severe (18). If you succeed, you automatically \[Move\] \[Nearby\] towards the water's surface. If the water's surface was \[Far\] away, you are still \[Drowning\]. Otherwise, you break the water's surface.

**Removal:** If you break the water's surface, you lose \[Drowning\].
