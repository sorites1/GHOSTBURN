## Suspicious

**Cause:** When you sense that someone may be lying, hiding something, or mispresenting the truth, you are \[Suspicious\]. This condition cannot be applied to player characters.

**Effect:** If you have a \[[[Keyword_Friendly|Friendly]]\] \[[[Keyword_Attitude|Attitude]]\] it worsens to \[[[Keyword_Neutral|Neutral]]\]. \[[[Keyword_Social|Social]]\] skills and tricks used against you have their DL raised by one. If the person you are \[Suspicious\] of is using a [[Trick_Deception_Disguise|Disguise]] or a [[Trick_Deception_Forgery|Forgery]], you may attempt to see through it. To see through a Disguise or Forgery, the GM makes a [[Keyword_Threat|Threat]] roll for the NPC and uses the DL set by the outcome the player achieved on their Disguise or Forgery roll.

**Removal:** If the subject of your suspicions improves your \[Attitude\] to \[Friendly\], you lose \[Suspicious\].
