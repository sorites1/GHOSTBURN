## Suspicious

**Cause:** When you sense that someone may be lying, hiding something, or mispresenting the truth, you are \[Suspicious\]. This condition cannot be applied to player characters.

**Effect:** If you have a Friendly Attitude it shifts to Neutral. \[Social\] skills and tricks used against you have their DL raised by one. If the person you are \[Suspicious\] of is using a Disguise or a Forgery, you may attempt to see through it.

**Removal:** If the subject of your suspicions raises your \[Attitude\] to Friendly, you lose \[Suspicious\].
