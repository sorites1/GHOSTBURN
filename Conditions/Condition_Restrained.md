# Restrained

**Cause:** When you are unable to \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Move|Move]]\] because something or someone is actively preventing you from doing so, you are \[Restrained\.

**Effect:** You are \[[[Conditions/Condition_Immobilized|Immobilized]]\]. On your turn, you can spend 1 AP to try and escape by making a basic \[Strength\] or \[Agility\] roll (your choice). If an NPC has subdued you, use their Fort as the DL. If you are being \[Restrained\] by rope, handcuffs, or the like, the GM should set the DL, typically at Severe (18). If you succeed, you escape by slipping out or breaking free. 

**Removal:** When you are released by whatever had you \[Restrained\], you lose \[Restrained\]. If attempt to escape and get a Success on your basic \[Strength\] or \[Agility\] roll, you lose \[Restrained\].
