## Deafened

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or environmental effect prevents you from hearing, you gain the \[Deafened\] condition. This condition replaces \[Hearing Impaired\].

**Effect:** You cannot hear, or you can only hear one thing (music in a nightclub, for example). You are immune to sound-based attacks. Attempts to use skill actions with the \[Vocal\] quality have their DL raised by one. You are unable to use skill actions that have the \[Auditory\] keyword.

**Removal:** When the condition of environmental effect that caused you to be \[Deafened\] is removed, you lose the \[Deafened\] condition.
