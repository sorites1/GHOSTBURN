# Agony

**Cause:** When a condition, effect, or injury causes you intense, unbearable pain, you are in \[Agony\].

**Effect:** All tricks have their DL raised by one and their outcomes \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Downgraded|Downgraded]]\]. Taking painkillers diminishes the effect of \[Agony\]. When you take painkillers, tricks still have their DL raised by one, but their outcomes are not \[Downgraded\]. The benefit of painkillers lasts until the end of the scene.

**Removal:** When the source of the \[Agony\] is removed, you lose the \[Agony\] condition. If you are in \[Agony\] due to an injury, receiving Surgery or Cybernetic Installation, as described in the injury's Recovery entry, causes you to lose the \[Agony\] condition.
