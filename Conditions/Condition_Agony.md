## Agony

**Cause:** When a condition, effect, or injury causes you intense, unbearable pain, you are in \[Agony\].

**Effect:** Skills and tricks have their DL raised by one and their outcomes are \[Downgraded\]. Taking painkillers diminishes the effect of \[Agony\]. When you take painkillers, skill actions have their DL raised by one (instead of two).

**Removal:** When the source of the \[Agony\] is removed, you lose the \[Agony\] condition. If you are in \[Agony\] due to an injury, receiving Surgery or Cybernetic Installation, as described in the injury's Recovery entry, causes you to lose the \[Agony\] condition.
