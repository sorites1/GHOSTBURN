# Foggy

**Cause:** When a lingering haze fills the air, obscuring people and objects in the distance, it is \[Foggy\].

**Effect:** Without some kind of imaging enhancement like \[[[Mods_Clearview|Clearview]]\], it is impossible to identify targets at \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Far|Far]]\] range (or beyond \[Far\] with a \[[[Mods_Scope|Scope]]\]) when it is \[Foggy\]. Targets who are \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Nearby|Nearby]]\] have \[[[Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial|Concealment, Partial]]\]. Targets who are \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Close|Close]]\] are unaffected.

**Removal:** When the fog thins or dissipates in an area, it loses \[Foggy\].
