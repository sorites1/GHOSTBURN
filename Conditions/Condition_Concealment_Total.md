## Concealment, Total

**Cause:** Your entire body, including your gear, are totally concealed and cannot be seen by an observer. It is possible to have \[Concealment, Total\] to one observer and not another.

**Effect:** Attacks made against you by an observer to whom you have \[Concealment, Total\] have their DL raised by two. Additionally, if an attacker scores a Success while you have \[Concealment, Total\], it is downgraded to a Fade. Attempts made by the observer to locate you through sight alone automatically fail.

**Removal:** When you become fully visible to an observer or switch to having \[Concealment, Partial\] to them, you no longer have \[Concealment, Total\] to them.
