## Concealment, Total

**Cause:** Your entire body, including your gear, is totally concealed and cannot be seen by an observer. It is possible to have \[Concealment, Total\] to one observer and not another.

**Effect:** When someone to whom you have \[Concealment, Total\] attempts to use a \[Visual\] trick on you, their DL raised by two and their outcome is \[[[Keyword_Downgraded|Downgraded]]\]. Attempts made by the observer to locate you through sight alone automatically fail.

**Removal:** When you become fully visible to an observer or switch to having \[[[Condition_Concealment_Partial|Concealment, Partial]]\] to them, you no longer have \[Concealment, Total\] to them.
