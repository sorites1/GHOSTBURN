# Bewildered

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or effect leaves you deeply and utterly confused, you are \[Bewildered\]. This counts as and replaces the \[[[Conditions/Condition_Distracted|Distracted]]\] condition.

**Effect:** Tricks used on you have their DL lowered by one and their outcomes are \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Upgraded|Upgraded]]\].

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, you lose the \[Bewildered\] condition.
