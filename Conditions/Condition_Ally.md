# Ally

**Cause:** When you achieve a Cool Success on certain specializations, you gain an \[Ally]\. If your trick was used on a \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Group|Group]]\], one representative individual fills this role.

**Effect:** The target gains an \[Attitude\] of Friendly. As long as the target is an \[Ally\], they will help you. Beyond just following your instructions or fulfilling your requests, an \[Ally\] will take the initiative to provide assistance. They will try to protect you as best they can, use their skills and knowledge to your benefit, and warn you before you put yourself in danger or miss an opportunity. 

**Removal:** If you (or any member of your crew) attacks your \[Ally\], the target loses \[Ally\]. When the scene ends, the target loses \[Ally]\, but you can try to make them a \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Contact|Contact]]\] (with the GM's approval). This requires a basic Presence roll with a DL of Severe (26). If you succeed, you permanently gain the target as a \[Contact\].
