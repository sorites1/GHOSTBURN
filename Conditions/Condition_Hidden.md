## Hidden

**Cause:** When you successfully use the Hide skill action, you gain the \[Hidden\] condition.

**Effect:** You are \[[[Condition_Undetected|Undetected]]\] and have \[Concealment, Total\].

**Removal:** When someone finds you, such as by using [[Trick_Perception_Core_Search|Search]] or you reveal your position by attacking, stepping out of cover, or making noise, you lose the \[Hidden\] condition.
