# Drugged

**Cause:** When a chemical interferes with your ability to move, speak, and think, you are \[Drugged\].

**Effect:** You gain \[[[Conditions/Condition_Cognitive_Impairment|Cognitive Impairment]]\], \[[[Conditions/Condition_Movement_Impaired|Movement Impaired]]\], \[[[Conditions/Condition_Off_Balance|Off Balance]]\], \[[[Conditions/Condition_Off_Guard|Off Guard]]\], \[[[Conditions/Condition_Speech_Impairment|Speech Impairment]]\], and \[[[Conditions/Condition_Vision_Impairment|Vision Impairment]]\].

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, make a \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Basic|Basic]]\] Resilience roll with a DL of Moderate (14). Success means you lose the \[Drugged\] condition. If you are still \[Drugged\] at the end of the scene, you lose \[Drugged\]. If you are given an antidote for the chemical affecting you, you lose \[Drugged\] immediately.
