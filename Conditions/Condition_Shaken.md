# Shaken

**Cause:** When a trick, condition, or effect leaves you momentarily shocked by what you saw or heard, you are \[Shaken\].

**Effect:** Skills and tricks used on you have their DL lowered by one. Skills and tricks you use have their DL raised by one.

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Easy (8). If you Succeed, you lose the \[Shaken\] condition. If you are still \[Shaken\] when the scene ends, you lose the \[Shaken\] condition.
