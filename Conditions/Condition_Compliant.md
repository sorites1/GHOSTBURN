## Compliant

**Cause:** When a person or group is compelled to perform actions under duress, they gain the \[Compliant\] condition. This condition cannot be applied to player characters.

**Effect:** The Attitude of the \[Compliant\] person or group shifts to Hostile. They follow your instructions, even if they go against their own self-interests, but they will not put their loved ones in harm's way. They will not attempt to escape or retaliate as long as you remain in the \[Vicinity\].

**Removal:** Forcing the target to do worse and more dangerous things requires a basic Presence roll (GM's discretion), and Failure means the target suffers a \[Break\]. Forcing the target to put their loved ones in harm's way causes them to automatically \[Break\]. If you or your crew attack the target, they suffer a \[Break\]. If you leave the \[Vicinity\] for more than one turn, the target automatically loses \[Compliant\] and flees or prepares to attack upon your return.
