# Undetected

**Cause:** If a person has not detected your presence, then you are \[Undetected\] by them.

**Effect:** When you attack a target for whom you are \[Undetected\], they are treated as \[[[Conditions/Condition_Off_Guard|Off Guard]]\] for that attack.

**Removal:** When you are seen or heard by someone, you are no longer \[Undetected\] to them.
