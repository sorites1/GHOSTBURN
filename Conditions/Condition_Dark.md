# Dark

**Cause:** When an area lacks sufficient illumination, making it very hard to see, it is \[Dark\].

**Effect:** When you are in the \[Dark\], you gain \[[[Conditions/Condition_Movement_Impaired|Movement Impaired]]\]. Also, targets at \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Close|Close]]\] range have \[[[Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial|Concealment, Partial]]\], and targets who are \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Nearby|Nearby]]\] or farther away in the \[Dark\] have \[[[Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Total|Concealment, Total]]\]. 

**Removal:** When an area is illuminated, it loses \[Dark\].
