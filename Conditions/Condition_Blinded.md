## Blinded

**Cause:** When an attack, condition, or environmental effect prevents you from seeing, you are \[Blinded\]. This condition replaces \[Vision Impairment\].

**Effect:** You cannot see. All targets have \[Concealment, Total\] from you. Skills and tricks with the \[Visual\] keyword have their DL raised by one and their outcomes \[Degraded\]. It is not possible to even attempt an action that is exclusively dependent upon sight, such as identifying the man in the bowler hat. You gain \[Movement Restricted\]. 

**Removal:** When the condition or environmental effect that caused you to be \[Blinded\] is removed, you lose the \[Blinded\] condition. In rare cases, this condition is permanent.
