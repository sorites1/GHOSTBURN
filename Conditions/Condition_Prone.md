# Prone

**Cause:** When you lay down on the ground or are forced down by a condition or an attack, you gain \[Prone\].

**Effect:** \[Ranged\] attacks made against you, except Point Blank Shot, have their DL raised by one. \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Melee|Melee]]\] attacks made against you have their DL lowered by one. On your turn while \[Prone\], you may spend 1 AP to stand up., While you remain \[Prone\], you are \[[[Conditions/Condition_Movement_Restricted|Movement Restricted]]\]. If you are swimming when forced to go \[Prone\], disregard the rest of this Effect and you begin \[[[Conditions/Condition_Drowning|Drowning]]\].

**Removal:** When you stand up, you lose the \[Prone\] condition.
