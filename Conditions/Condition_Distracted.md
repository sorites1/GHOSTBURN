## Distracted

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or effect causes you to become unfocused and momentarily lose track of what you were doing, you are \[Distracted\].

**Effect:** Skills and tricks used on you have their DL lowered by one.

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, you lose the \[Distracted\] condition.
