## Distracted

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or effect causes you to become unfocused and momentarily lose track of what you were doing, you are \[Distracted\].

**Effect:** You are \[Off Guard\].

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, you lose the \[Distracted\] condition. You also lose \[Distracted\] if you are in the presence of danger.
