## Unconscious

**Cause:** When you gain the \[Dying\] condition, you also gain \[Unconscious\]. You can also be rendered \[Unconscious\] by certain tricks or conditions.

**Effect:** You are \[Immobilized\], \[Incapable\], \[Prone\], \[Unaware\], and \[Unresponsive\].

**Removal:** If you are \[Dying\], you must be \[Stabilized\] with at least 1 hp to lose the \[Unconscious\] condition. If another condition or effect caused you to become \[Unconscious\], and it has its own Removal, you must abide by it. If no other Removal is indicated, then at the start of your turn, make a base Resilience roll with a DL of Easy (6). Success means you lose the \[Unconscious\] condition.
