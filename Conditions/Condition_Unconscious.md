# Unconscious

**Cause:** When you gain the \[[[Conditions/Condition_Dying|Dying]]\] condition, you also gain \[Unconscious\]. You can also be rendered \[Unconscious\] by certain tricks or conditions.

**Effect:** You are \[[[Conditions/Condition_Immobilized|Immobilized]]\], \[[[Conditions/Condition_Incapable|Incapable]]\], \[[[Conditions/Condition_Prone|Prone]]\], \[[[Conditions/Condition_Unaware|Unaware]]\], and \[[[Conditions/Condition_Unresponsive|Unresponsive]]\].

**Removal:** If you are \[Dying\], you must be \[[[Conditions/Condition_Stabilized|Stabilized]]\] with at least 1 hp to lose the \[Unconscious\] condition. If another condition or effect caused you to become \[Unconscious\], and it has its own Removal, you must abide by it. If no other Removal is indicated, then at the start of your turn, make a base Resilience roll with a DL of Easy (8). Success means you lose the \[Unconscious\] condition.
