# Dying

**Cause:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you gain the \[Dying\] condition. This condition follows and replaces \[[[Conditions/Condition_Healthy|Healthy]]\], \[[[Conditions/Condition_Wounded|Wounded]]\], \[[[Conditions/Condition_Severely_Wounded|Severely Wounded]]\], and \[Death's Door\].

**Effect:** You are \[[[Conditions/Condition_Unconscious|Unconscious]]\]. Make a mark. At the start of your turn, make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Hard (14). Success means you gain the \[[[Conditions/Condition_Stabilized|Stabilized]]\] condition. Failure means you make another mark. If you accumulate more marks than your Resilience score, you are dead.

**Removal:** When you gain \[Stabilized\], you lose the \[Dying\] condition. You have 1 hit point.
