## Dying

**Cause:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you gain the \[Dying\] condition. This condition follows and replaces \[Healthy\], \[Wounded\], \[Severely Wounded\], and \[Death's Door\].

**Effect:** You are \[Unconscious\]. Make a mark. At the start of your turn, make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Hard (14). Success means you gain the \[Stabilized\] condition. Failure means you make another mark. If you accumulate more marks than your Resilience score, you are dead.

**Removal:** When you gain \[Stabilized\], you lose the \[Dying\] condition. You have 1 hit point.
