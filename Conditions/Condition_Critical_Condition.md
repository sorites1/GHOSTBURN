## Critical Condition

**Cause:** When you have sustained a \[[[Condition_Life_Threatening|Life Threatening]]\] injury and were subsequently \[[[Condition_Stabilized|Stabilized]]\] only to then fail your basic Resilience roll at the start of a scene, you enter \[Critical Condition\]. You can also gain \[Critical Condition\] as the result of Surgery or Cybernetic Installation that ends in critical failure.

**Effect:** At the end of each hour that passes, relative to you, make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Severe (18). If you succeed, you gain \[Stabilized\]. If you fail, make a mark. If you accumulate more marks than your Resilience score, you advance to \[[[Condition_Dying|Dying]]\].

**Removal:** When you gain \[Stabilized\], you lose \[Critical Condition\]. Any marks accumulated from failed basic Resilience rolls are reset to zero.
