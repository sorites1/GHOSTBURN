# Night Vision

\[Night Vision\] is a quality that can be applied to goggles, helmets (with visor), video cameras, and \[[[Aug_Cybernetic_Eye|Cybernetic Eyes]]\]. When \[Night Vision\] is active, you can see as well in the darkness as you can in the light. You ignore the effects of \[[[Conditions/Condition_Dark|Dark]]\].

When you are exposed to a bright light while using \[Night Vision], you are immediately \[[[Conditions/Condition_Blinded|Blinded]]\]. If you disable \[Night Vision\], you lose \[Blinded\] at the end of your turn.
