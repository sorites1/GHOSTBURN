The Dark One is the Devil. He is sinister, charming, and convincing. He is cool, but he can also be ferocious. Most importantly, he is unreadable. His motives are totally opaque to mere mortals. People might spend a lot of energy trying to understand what the Dark One wants, or what its plan is, but their efforts are futile. The ritual, pageantry, and sacrifice are real because they work. But the Dark One is just one face of the Unknowable Beast.
