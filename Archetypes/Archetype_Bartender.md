## Bartender

**Keywords:** \[Common\], \[Street\]

The Bartender works in a tavern or bar where they serve drinks and listen to people's stories. Ostensibly a straightforward job, the Bartender has learned how to be available without being obtrusive, and how to deal with someone who's had too much to drink. Understanding the bar's clientele is crucial to providing good service, and the Bartender tends to display a surprising level of cultural awareness.
