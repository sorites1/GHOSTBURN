## Bartender

**Keywords:** \[Common\], \[Street\]

The Bartender works in a bar serving drinks to paying customers. A straightforward job at first glance, the Bartender knows how to be available without being obtrusive, how to listen without caring, and how to deal with someone who's had too much to drink. Understanding the bar's clientele is crucial to providing good service, and the Bartender tends to display a surprising level of cultural awareness. Drinking establishments in Ridgeworld run the gamut, from dingy watering holes to upscale martini bars, the sprawl has thousands of places to get a drink, and tens of thousands who serve them. The Bartender knows all too well that alcohol loosens peoples' lips, which usually only leads to trouble for the drinker. However, rumors persist of the odd Politicorp Employee or Mil-Sec Detective getting blasted out of their minds and letting slip some secret that turned the world upside down for everyone in the bar that night.
