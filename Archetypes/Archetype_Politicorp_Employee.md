## Politicorp Employee

**Keywords:** \[Common\], \[Professional\], \[Corporate\]

The Politicorp Employee is a bureaucrat, a government drone, with just a hint of responsibility and power. The banality of it all, the cramped, windowless office, the never-ending requests to process, and the insufferable obsequiousness displayed by most employees makes the job of the Politicorp Employee impossibly unfulfilling. Still, most took the position because they were driven to do *some* good in the world. The reality is that the Politicorp Employee's road leads to one of three destinations: 1) embracing and benefiting from corruption, 2) realizing there is no way to actually make a difference and being resigned to perpetuate the system because it pays the bills; or 3) a wholesale rejection of the system and a determination to either stop taking part or to facilitate its destruction.
