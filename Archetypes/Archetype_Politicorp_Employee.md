## Politicorp Employee

**Keywords:** \[Common\], \[Professional\], \[Corporate\]

The Politicorp Employee is a professional bureaucrat with just a hint of responsibility and power. The banality of it all, the cramped, windowless office, the never-ending requests to process, and the insufferable obsequiousness displayed by most employees makes the job impossibly unfulfilling. Still, most took the position because they were driven to do *some* good in the world. The reality is that the Politicorp Employee's road leads to one of three destinations: 1) embrace the corruption and profit from it, 2) accept that nothing will change but keep doing the job because it pays the bills; or 3) reject the system and resolve to either withdraw from it completely or work to facilitate its destruction.
