## Street Doc

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Professional\], \[Street\]

The Street Doc provides medical services to customers who need help, but only to those with a reference. Preferring to stay underground and rely on repeat customers, the Street Doc does not advertise their services. Instead of a clinic, the Street Doc operates in locations one might not suspect. A mobile Street Doc who moves around might use a hotel room, backroom, and even a public restroom as a temporary operating theater. Those who are more permanently situated choose a place that is unlikely to draw attention, often an apartment or small house, where they can work in peace.
