## Mil-Sec Patroller

**Keywords:** \[Common\], \[Professional\], \[Street\]

The Mil-Sec Patroller works for a law enforcement corporation that sells its services to neighborhoods at varying levels of coverage. In lieu of a law enforcement contract, individuals are left to protect their homes themselves. Coalitions of residents sometimes form into a kind of militarized neighborhood watch, but these groups tend to be unstable and dissolve without strong leadership. The Mil-Sec Patroller is often paired with a partner and issued a patrol vehicle so they can cruise through the neighborhoods to which they are assigned. The patrol vehicle also enables the Mil-Sec Patroller to quickly respond to orders issued by central command. The level of respect and quality of enforcement residents can expect is directly proportional to the amount of money spent on the contract. Wealthy neighborhoods tend to be looked after by Mil-Sec Patrollers who are higher educated, more socially aware, and better looking than those at the other end of the spectrum. In fact, the lowest level contracts are little more than an assurance that locals will be harassed, robbed, and beaten by the Mil-Sec Patrollers assigned to protect them.
