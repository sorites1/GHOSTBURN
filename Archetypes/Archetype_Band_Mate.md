## Band Mate

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Street\]

The Band Mate performs in front of live and virtual audiences. Alternatively, they could be part of the band's road crew or entourage. Regardless, the experience is marked by big personalities, a lust for money, heartache, and pain. At the same time, it's likely the greatest and most unique experience the Band Mate has ever had. The sheer debauchery, wild parties, and copious amounts of drugs offer an allure to some, and those things are fun, to be sure. It could be because the Band Mate gets close to fame without ever really having it, or maybe it's due to an inner strength gained by playing a supporting role, but more often than not, the people in this position are able to take a taste, enjoy themselves, and then step away. Not everyone, of course, is that lucky.
