## Ex Con

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Underground\], \[Street\]

The Ex Con is someone who was convicted of a crime in one of the corporate courts and sent to lockup to do hard time. When the opportunity to join the Get-Out-Early program by volunteering for hazard duty, the Ex Con jumped at the chance. Moved from one form of prison to another, the Ex Con spent a year living and working on a corporate oil rig off the coast, working as a gas harvester at a penal colony in Spinebreak, or some equally dangerous job before meeting qualifications for release and being returned to the regular world. Once on the outside, the Ex Con is managed by a handler responsible for helping them secure a paying job and reintegrating them back into society. The reality is that a handler is equally likely to provide introductions and job opportunities that put the Ex Con back on the path to crime.
