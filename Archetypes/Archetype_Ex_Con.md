## Ex-Con

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Underground\], \[Street\]

The Ex-Con is someone who was convicted of a crime in one of the corporate courts and sent to lockup to do hard time. When the opportunity to join the Get-Out-Early program by volunteering for hazard duty, the Ex-Con jumped at the chance. Moved from one form of prison to another, the Ex-Con spent a year living and working on a corporate oil rig off the coast, working as a gas harvester at a penal colony in Spinebreak, or some equally dangerous job before meeting qualifications for release and being returned to the regular world. Once on the outside, the Ex-Con is managed by a handler responsible for helping them secure a paying job and reintegrating them back into society. The reality is that a handler is equally likely to provide introductions and job opportunities that put the Ex-Con back on the path to crime.
