## Gun Tech

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Professional\], \[Underground\]

The Gun Tech is a trained professional responsible for the inventory, maintenance, and enhancement of firearms and heavy weapons. Megacorp Mil-Sec teams, law enforcement corporations, and even large politicorp offices have their own Gun Techs who work out of the organization's armory. In most cases, the job is too big for one person to handle alone, and so small teams of Gun Techs, or, more likely, a lead Gun Tech and their assistants, work together to carry out the duties of the position. Working in a well-funded armory can allow the Gun Tech to pursue research and development of firearm enhancements and can even afford them the opportunity to develop their own prototypes.
