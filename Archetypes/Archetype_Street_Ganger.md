## Street Ganger

**Keywords:** \[Common\], \[Street\]

The Street Ganger was born into poverty and grew up around drugs and violence. Joining a gang at a young age meant having security, friendship, and money, all of which are hard to come by in the sprawl, especially for someone who's trying to make it on their own. Over time, though, the street teaches valuable lessons about survival and so-called loyalty. The Street Ganger that doesn't listen when the street speaks is likely to end up in prison or dead.
