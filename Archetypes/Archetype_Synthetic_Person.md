## Synthetic Person

**Keywords:** \[Ultra Rare\]

The Synthetic Person is a machine designed and constructed to be a high-fidelity facsimile of a human being. Overlayed with organic skin, the Synthetic Person is built on a titanium chassis and equipped with a pseudo-brain, a scientific marvel that leverages authentic, biological, neural processes and a language-driven software model to generate rich, human-like speech and behavior. Marketed as service bots to the ultra wealthy, the Synthetic Person has been known to exhibit a condition called *personality emergence.* Internal monitors detect this phenomenon and flag the unit for auto-recall, but sometimes, monitoring fails and the Synthetic Person slips  through the cracks.
