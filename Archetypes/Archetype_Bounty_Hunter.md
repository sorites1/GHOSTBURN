## Bounty Hunter

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Professional\]

The Bounty Hunter is a professional who specializes in the tracking and recovery of live human targets. Hired by megacorps to find and return escaped Arcology Denizens or even by Politicorp Handlers to track down AWOL Mil-Sec assets under their purview, the Bounty Hunter is the consummate freelancer, accepting jobs at will and beholden to no one and nothing beyond the current contract. Without the resources of (or ties to) a megacorp, politicorp, or Mil-Sec operation, the Bounty Hunter is simultaneously well positioned to investigate and working at a major disadvantage, depending on who or what is responsible for the target's disappearance.
