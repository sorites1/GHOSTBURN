## Mafia Enforcer

**Keywords:** \[Rare\], \[Underground\], \[Street\]

The Mafia Enforcer belongs to the family-based crime organization that traces its roots back hundreds of years to the Old World. The Mafia Enforcer is a soldier, first and foremost, and willingly accepts orders as they are given. Barring any direction to the contrary, however, the Mafia Enforcer's main job is to collect from those who owe cred (from gambling debts, unpaid favors, and outstanding business obligations) to one of the organization's captains. Anyone who can't or won't pay gets a swift beating, a few broken bones, and a ride in the red+bus to the hospital. Even if the full amount cannot be repaid all at once, good faith payments are appreciated, and the Mafia Enforcer takes them into consideration when determining if additional "motivation" is appropriate.
