## Mafia Enforcer

**Keywords:** \[Rare\], \[Underground\], \[Street\]

The Mafia Enforcer belongs to the family-based criminal organization by the same name, which traces its roots back hundreds of years to the Old World. The Mafia Enforcer is a soldier, first and foremost, and willingly accepts orders as they are given. Barring any direction to the contrary, however, the Mafia Enforcer's main job is to collect from those who owe cred to one of the organization's captains. Anyone who can't or won't pay gets a swift beating, a few broken bones, and a trip to the emergency room. A single day might entail making visits to a dozen or more individuals, and then the next day, it starts all over again.
