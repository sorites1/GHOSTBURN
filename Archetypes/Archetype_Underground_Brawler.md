## Underground Brawler

**Keywords:** \[Rare\], \[Underground\]

The Underground Brawler is a bareknuckle fighter employed by one of the organized crime rackets in the city. In a world of cybernetic enhancement, people are inexplicably drawn to the spectacle of two, unaugmented boxers beating the absolute hell out of one another until only one of them is left standing. The life of the Underground Brawler is raucous, bloody, and brutal, and for many, it is a direct path to a permanent dirt nap. A lucky few manage to win their freedom in the ring or try escaping through other means, but most are resigned to their fates, just so long as they can take a few with them before they go.
