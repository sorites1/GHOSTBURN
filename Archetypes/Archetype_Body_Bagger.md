## Body Bagger

**Keywords:** \[Rare\], \[Underground\], \[Street\]

The Body Bagger is usually part of a small team of self-starters that goes out every night to grab the world with both hands. Operating out of the back of a van, the Body Bagger and their associates are highly mobile. They rove the city streets chasing sirens and scanning Mil-Sec emergency channels for bloody tips. When they find a corpse that's still warm to the touch, the Body Bagger collects the "fresh meat" and quickly delivers it in exchange for fair payment. It is no secret that society at large actively abhors Body Baggers (which is, perhaps, the reason so many choose to wear masks). As with all things, though, if there is a market for something, there are sellers and buyers. The Body Bagger sells the bodies they recover to street docs, as one might expect, but also to corporate hospitals and clinics.
