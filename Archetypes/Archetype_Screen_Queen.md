## Screen Queen

**Keywords:** \[Common\], \[Net\]

The Screen Queen is addicted to becoming Net famous. Most use streaming drones, little fliers that follow the Screen Queen around, allowing them to stream live video 24x7 (even in their sleep) for their fans to watch. The Screen Queen often pushes themselves to accumulate watchers by taking more risks and flirting with greater dangers. That experience can have a profound affect on a Screen Queen to the point where many forget who they really are. (Note that Screen Queen is a term that applies to anyone who is addicted to Net fame, regardless of their gender or preferences.)
