## Vice Merchant

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Underground\], \[Street\]

The Vice Merchant sells what people want. Drugs, sex, and *opies* (OPE's, or Other Peoples' Experiences) in all different flavors, grades, and purities. The Ridgeworld sprawl offers an endless supply of customers, so most Vice Merchants specialize to stand out. By catering to certain types of customers who want certain kinds of things, the Vice Merchant can make a name for themselves on the street. Some even build their own brand identity to represent themselves and what they provide, though the real survivors tend to stick to the shadows.
