## Organ Harvester

**Keywords:** \[Rare\], \[Underground\], \[Professional\]

The Organ Harvester, sometimes called a ***ghoul***, is a hunter of human prey. Underground, black market message boards are used by the desperate and the greedy to put out requests for replacement organs that meet specific biological requirements. To mitigate the potential for a host to reject an organ transplant, an array of criteria must be identified and validated against any potential donor. Having broad access to individual medical histories and profiles is key to the Organ Harvester's work, as it is necessary to filter down to as few donors as possible to maximize the likelihood of a match. Once a target is  identified, the Organ Harvester follows them until they can take a blood sample, an act typically performed in a crowded location like a subway. Using the blood sample, the Organ Harvester confirms the match and moves in. They snatch the donor off the street and perform the organ removal as quickly as possible, placing the organ in a cooler until it can be delivered and payment is received. Depending on the Organ Harvester, they might either replace the stolen organ with one of lesser quality or just dump the body in the sprawl and leave them to die.
