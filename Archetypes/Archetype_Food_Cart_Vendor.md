## Food Cart Vendor

**Keywords:** \[Common\], \[Street\]

The Food Cart Vendor makes a living selling food on the street to walkers-by. It may be a humble job, but it is honest work, and for some it can provide a sense of self worth from being able to feed people a hot meal. The quality of food offered by Food Cart Vendors varies greatly, with some offering flavor paste and protein bits in a wrap while others serve up jerked chorky, so named due to its unique combination of synthetic chicken, turkey and pork. The Food Cart Vendor is only as successful as the place where they set up shop, which, according to city tradition, means going to a new location each day of the week and then starting the rotation over again once a new week begins. Primo spots are highly coveted, which can unfortunately lead to hostilities between Food Cart Vendors. As such, it is not uncommon for the Food Cart Vendor to come to work armed.
