## Politicorp Handler

**Keywords:** \[Rare\], \[Professional\]

The Politicorp Handler is ostensibly employed by a politicorp, one of many political arms of a megacorp. However bureaucratic their responsibilities may appear on the surface, the reality is that the Politicorp Handler has direct ties to the Mil-Sec industry. The Politicorp Handler works out of a traditional office and manages a dozen or more assets like the Mil-Sec Sniper and Mil-Sec Detective, though it is exceedingly rare for an asset to ever meet their supervisor in person, much less see their face. Communications between the Politicorp Handler and their assets are strictly encoded and top secret.
