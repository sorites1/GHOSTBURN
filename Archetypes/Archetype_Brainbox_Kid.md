## Brainbox Kid

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Street\]

The Brainbox Kid is an extremely intelligent, highly capable street urchin. Drawn to technology in all its forms, they're a fast learner with a penchant for mischief, which is what led to their interest in street hacking. Totally self-taught, the Brainbox Kid built their own cyber rig from parts they stole, scavenged, or bought off a Technomonger. A few friends, a car, and Friday night is a recipe for wardriving, cruising around, hacking everything in sight, from traffic lights to robo-taxis. It's fun for ones who are just along for the ride, but for the Brainbox Kid, the streets are the training grounds.
