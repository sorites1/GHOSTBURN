## Surgical Resident

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Professional\]

The Surgical Resident spent years in medical school, costing an obscene amount of money, but it was all worth it to be where they are today. The feeling of saving a life through precision and skill, of holding a beating heart and knowing that *you* are the balance, *you* are the pendulum that swings, and you alone make the difference between life and death. That feeling is powerful drug in its own right, and it is one that the Surgical Resident cannot resist.
