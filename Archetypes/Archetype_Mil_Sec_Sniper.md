## Mil-Sec Sniper

**Keywords:** \[Rare\], \[Professional\]

The Mil-Sec Sniper is classified as an Advanced Rapid Response Operations Weapon (ARROW) and is deployed for a singular, tactical purpose: to eliminate threat. Highly paid, the Mil-Sec Sniper is typically reserved for cases that require precision in a situation that is logistically challenging to mitigate through other means. Mil-Sec Snipers can be assigned to a team, but more often, they are urban nomads, moving from place to place as they receive new orders from their politicorp handler. As such, they travel light, able to pick up and go at a moment's notice. The Mil-Sec Sniper's most important possession, of course, is their rifle, and they keep it with them at all times, though it is sometimes necessary to disassemble their weapon so as to avoid unwanted attention.
