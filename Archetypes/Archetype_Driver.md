## Driver

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Street\]

The Driver is a professional transporter of passengers or goods too valuable or risky to move in a traditional manner. In a world where self-driving vehicles are ubiquitous, the Driver demands manual control. Every pump of the clutch, shift in gear, and flick of the tachometer is a direct product of the synergy between the Driver and the machine. Capable of handling anything with wheels, each Driver has their favorite, a vehicle that may seem more like a partner than a prized possession. Luckily, corporate benefactors can easily provide access to a secure garage, as can the Mafia and Yakuza, on the other side of the equation.
