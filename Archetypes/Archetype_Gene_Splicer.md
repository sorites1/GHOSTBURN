## Gene Splicer

**Keywords:** \[Rare\], \[Professional\], \[Underground\]

The Gene Splicer performs unlicensed genetic modifications in an underground lab. The pay is excellent and the work is engaging, but it also puts the Gene Splicer face-to-face with some truly scary individuals. Invariably, the Gene Spicer believes their work is a key to unlocking the next evolution of humankind. The outcomes of their genetic experiments, however, are often anything but advanced. Painful mutations and deformities plague most subjects, and while many Gene Splicers limit their work to animal test subjects, some believe human trials offer the most potential for good results. In fact, it is not uncommon for Gene Splicers to experiment on themselves. Not all experiments performed by Gene Splicers end in failure though, and a bourgeoning market for genetic manipulation is starting to grow. It is rumored that some Gene Splicers may have even unlocked the gateway to psionic powers.
