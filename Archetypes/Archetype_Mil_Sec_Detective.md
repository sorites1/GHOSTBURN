## Mil-Sec Detective

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Professional\], \[Street\]

The Mil-Sec Detective belongs to corporate law enforcement and works in an investigative unit charged with solving crimes that threaten the company's bottom line. Mil-Sec Detectives work cases involving fraud, infidelity, identity theft, sabotage, and murder. While they are responsible for digging into the details to determine who knew what and when, only some cases are sent forward to the Corporate Justice System where the culprit faces a judge and jury. At least as often, the Mil-Sec Detective reports their findings back up the chain to their faceless superior (who works on another floor and only communicates in written form) takes over. What happens from there, the Mil-Sec Detective will likely never know.
