## Trauma Medic

**Keywords:** \[Common\], \[Professional\], \[Street\]

The Trauma Medic is one of the first to arrive at the scene of a firefight, collision, or disaster. Ostensibly employed by one of the healthcare megacorps, the  Trauma Medic spends their time on the streets, riding in a *red+bus*, a (lightly armored) emergency response vehicle designed to transport the injured and wounded. The longer they dedicate themselves to their work, the more bloodshed and death they see, and it's not uncommon for a Trauma Medic to wash out after a year or two. The ones who stay on the job become hardened so they can remain effective.
