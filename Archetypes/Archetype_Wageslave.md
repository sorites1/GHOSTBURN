## Wageslave

**Keywords:** \[Common\]

The Wageslave is a low-level worker, a cog in the machine, trapped in a job they hate, earning barely enough to survive, and consuming what little comforts  they can, before they die. Most Wageslaves work menial, retail jobs, like those found in coffee shops, fast food restaurants, and general goods stores, but some work entry-level positions in other industries, such as data entry analyst, administrative assistant, or front desk staff. Some Wageslaves dream of another life, but most barely have enough time to catch their breath.
