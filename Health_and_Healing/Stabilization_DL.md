## Stabilization DL

When your character sustains a significant injury or drops to 0 hp and starts \[Dying\], they need to be \[Stabilized\] by someone who can make a Medicine (First Aid) roll. Your Stabilization DL is the Difficulty Level used for those rolls.

Your Stabilization DL is based on your Resilience score, as shown below.

| Resilience Score | Stabilization DL |
