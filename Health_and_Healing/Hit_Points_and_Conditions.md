# Hit Points and Conditions

Your character's health is measured in hit points (hp) and is based on your Strength and Resilience scores.

All characters have a maximum number of hit points equal to (Strength + Resilience) x 5.

For example, a character with Strength 2 and Resilience 4 would have:

| Step | Example Hit Point Calculation    |
| :--: | :------------------------------- |
|  1   | (2 + 4) x 5 = Maximum hit points |
|  2   | (6) x 5 = 30                     |
|  3   | 30 hp Max                        |
 
## Calculating Health Conditions

Calculate your health conditions as shown below. When dividing a score in half results in a fraction, **round up.**

| Health Condition | Hit Points                  | Example with 30 hp Max |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Healthy          | Max Hit Points              | 30 hp                  |
| Wounded          | Half of Healthy             | 15 hp                  |
| Severely Wounded | Half of Wounded             | 8 hp                   |
| Death's Door     | Half of Severely<br>Wounded | 4 hp                   |
