## Health Condition Effects

You can only have one health condition at a time, and your health condition changes when your hit points drop below (or rise above) the one you currently have. 

For example, a character that has max hit points (30 hp) gets shot in the back. They take 10 points of damage. This reduces their hit points to from 30 hp to 20 hp. Their current hit points are still in the \[Healthy\] range because the next level down, \[Wounded\], starts at 15 hp. If this character gets shot again and takes another 10 points of damage, they will go from 20 hp to 10 hp, and that will drop them down from being \[Healthy\] to being \[Wounded\].
