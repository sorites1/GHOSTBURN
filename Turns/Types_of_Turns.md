## Action Points

At the start of your turn, you get 3 Action Points (AP), which you can spend to take actions, such as to draw a weapon, [[Keyword_Move|Move]], or use a trick. On your turn, each action you take costs 1 AP. You cannot save AP turn over turn. If you decide to end your turn without spending all three AP, you lose the remainder (though they will refresh as normal at the start of your next turn)

## Types of Turns

There are four types of turns in this game: **out-of-combat turns**, **combat turns**, **group turns**, and **GM turns**. This game makes no mechanical distinction between out-of-combat and in-combat turns. However, it may be easier to think of turns that way. 
### Out-of-Combat Turns

During an out-of-combat turn, you might tell the GM your character wants to sneak into the warehouse you learned about from your contact.. The GM sets the scene, and you describe what your character is doing. You decide to hop the fence, and the GM calls for an [[Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Athletics_Core_Athletic_Move|Athletic Move]] roll (1 AP). As you cautiously approach the warehouse, the GM calls for a [[Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Stealth_Core_Sneak|Sneak]] roll (1 AP) to avoid being noticed by the patrolling guards. Last, you use [[Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Hacking_Core_Disable_Device|Disable Device]] (1 AP) to override the electronic lock on the door. Those three actions used your 3 AP. If you want to go inside and explore further, you'll have to wait until your next turn. 

The GM is not required to call for any rolls during your turn, and it's important to remember [[When_to_Roll|When to Roll]]. Out-of-combat turns can feel less structured than combat turns and rely on both the GM and player to regulate the amount of time spent.

### Combat Turns

During a combat turn, the types of actions may be different, but the process works the same way. If you \[[[Keyword_Move|Move]]\] to an area \[[[Keyword_Nearby|Nearby]]\] (1 AP), draw your weapon (1 AP), and use [[Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Firearms_Core_Burst_Fire|Burst Fire]] to attack an enemy (1 AP), you have spent a total of 3 AP, and your turn ends. At the start of your next turn, your AP will refresh, and you can take three more actions.

### Group Turns

When the group is partially or completely together in the same place at the same time, the GM is free to drop individual turns in favor of group turns. Group turns offer a loose, **collaborative segment** in which players share their ideas and narrate their character's actions without a formal turn order. This is a great time to let the players show off their characters' personalities and quirks, and it lets them roleplay with one another.

Group turns are especially useful when time is compressed or actions are routine, such as when the characters travel together across the city, a trip that could take a couple of hours or more. If players prefer to stay in the round robin turn order during group scenes, that is perfectly fine. Some players may want the opportunity to narrate what their character is doing during this moment of downtime.

Anyone not part of these group turns should still be given their individual turns, whether regular or combat.

### GM Turns

When play comes back to the GM, it signals a **potential escalation**. The GM can use their turn to introduce new characters into a scene, whether in combat or not. The GM should also use their turn to run the opposition against those who are in combat.
