## Types of Turns

There are four types of turns in this game: **regular turns**, **combat turns**, **group turns**, and **GM turns**.

### Regular Turns

A regular turn happens outside of combat and typically involves narration and making a roll or two. You might describe your character doing something dangerous like sneaking into a warehouse on the docks. 

During your turn, you can take **two actions** that move the game forward. The GM may call for up to two rolls, such as an Athletics (Physical Activity) roll to hop the fence before the security guard comes back and a Stealth (Sneak) roll to navigate the maze of containers on the dock without being noticed. If you then need to make a Street Hack roll to open the maglock, that will have to wait until next turn. 

However, this is not a hard rule, and the GM is not required to call for two (or any) rolls. Regular turns are less structured than combat turns and rely on both the GM and the player to regulate the amount of time spent.

### Combat Turns

A combat turn is strictly regimented by the use of **action points (AP)**. The number of action points you get is based on your character's Intelligence score. Cyberware like Wired Reflexes can also add action points to your pool. 

At the start of your turn in combat, your action points are refreshed. Each action you take in combat costs 1 AP. You may spend your AP as you wish throughout your turn. Once all of your AP is spent, or you do not wish to spend them all, your turn is over. 

For example, if you choose to move (1 AP), draw your weapon (1 AP), and use Firearms (Burst Fire) to attack an enemy (1 AP), you have spent a total of 3 AP. Assuming your character has only 3 AP, that is all you can do on your turn. Next turn, your AP refreshes and you can take three more actions. 

### Group Turns

When the group is partially or completely together in the same place at the same time, the GM is free to drop individual turns in favor of group turns. Group turns offer a loose, **collaborative segment** in which players share their ideas and narrate their character's actions without a formal turn order. This is a great time to let the players show off their characters' personalities and quirks, and it lets them roleplay with one another.

Group turns are especially useful when time is compressed or actions are routine, such as when the characters travel together across the city, a trip that could take a couple of hours or more. If players prefer to stay in the round robin turn order during group scenes, that is perfectly fine. Some players may want the opportunity to narrate what their character is doing during this moment of downtime.

Anyone not part of these group turns should still be given their individual turns, whether regular or combat.

### GM Turn

When play comes back to the GM, it signals a **potential escalation**. The GM can use their turn to introduce new characters into a scene, whether in combat or not. The GM should also use their turn to run the opposition against those who are in combat.
