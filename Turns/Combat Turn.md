# Combat Turn

A combat [[Turns|turn]] is strictly regimented by the use of 3 Action Points (AP). At the start of your turn, you gain 3 AP if you are in combat. You may spend your AP as you wish throughout your turn. Once all of your AP is spent, or you do not wish to spend them all, your turn is over.
