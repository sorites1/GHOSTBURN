# Round Robin: The Flow of the Game

This game uses a round robin turn-taking style for all scenes and actions, including those in combat and out of combat. In fact, in terms of player facetime with the GM, *this game makes no distinction between combat and non-combat turns*.

It is possible for some players to be in combat while other players are not. This does not alter the [[Turn Order|turn order]]. The game will always proceed in a [[Round Robin Turn Order|round robin]] manner, even if that means you end up with a mix, such as, one player takes a turn in combat, the next player takes a turn *outside of combat*, and the last player takes a turn *in a different combat*.

This game is designed to allow players to have their characters act independently from one another without forcing anyone to "sit out" until one group's actions have been resolved. Instead, this game blends everyone's actions together in an orderly way by requiring everyone to
take turns.
