## Turn Order

Each time your group assembles, whether online or in person, to play the game, the GM will start by setting the stage, reminding everyone of the events of last session, and so on. 

Play begins with the player to the GM's left. They describe what their character does, and the GM responds accordingly. Then, play proceeds to the left and the next player takes a turn, and so on, until everyone has taken a turn, and play comes back to the GM.

It is not necessary to maintain the same turn order from session to session, and players are free to choose different seats at the start of each session. On the other hand, some groups may prefer a consistent order and will choose to keep their same seats every session.
