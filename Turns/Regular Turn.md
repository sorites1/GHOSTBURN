# Regular Turn

A regular [[Turns|turn]] typically involves narration and may include the use of a few skill actions. You might describe your character doing something dangerous like sneaking into an abandoned warehouse. 

During your turn, the GM may call for up to three rolls, such as a Climb / Jump roll to hop the fence, a Move Silently roll to avoid notice, and a Street Hack roll to open the lock. 

However, this is not a hard rule, and the GM is not required to call for three (or any) rolls. Regular turns are less structured than combat turns and rely on both the GM and the player to regulate the amount of time spent.
