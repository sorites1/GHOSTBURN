 Hostile

When an NPC has an \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Attitude|Attitude]]\] of \[Hostile\] towards you, they are discourteous and unkind to you, and they might even \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Attack|Attack]]\] you. When you use a \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Social|Social]]\] trick on a \[Hostile\] NPC, raise the DL by one.

If an NPC's \[Attitude\] is \[Hostile\] and something causes it to improve, it moves to \[Neutral\]. If something causes it to worsen, the target stays at Hostile gains the \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Break|Break]]\] condition.
