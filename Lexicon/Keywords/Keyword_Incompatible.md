# Incompatible

Two things that cannot work together are \[Incompatible\]. When you encounter this keyword, it will be in reference to two things, such as two augments or a weapon and a mod. For example, \[[[Dermal_Armor|Dermal Armor]]\] and \[[[Subdermal_Nanoweave|Subdermal Nanoweave]]\] are \[Incompatible\], which means if you have one installed, you cannot install the other.
