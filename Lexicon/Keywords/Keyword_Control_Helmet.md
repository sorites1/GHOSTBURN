# Control Helmet

A helmet designed for use with a \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Control_Deck|Control Deck]]\], often stylized with an opaque visor. A \[Control Helmet\] is \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Incompatible|Incompatible]]\] with the [[Cybernetic_Augments/Aug_Control_Port|Control Port]] augment. That is, if you have a \[Control Port\] augment, you have no need for a \[Control Helmet\].
