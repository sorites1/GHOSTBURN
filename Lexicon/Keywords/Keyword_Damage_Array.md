# Damage Array

Damage for a weapon or an unarmed brawl attack is expressed as a \[Damage Array\], which is a set of three numbers, separated by slashes, such as 5/10/25. These are the \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage|Minimum Damage]]], \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage|Normal Damage]]\], and \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Maximum_Damage|Maximum Damage]]] values, respectively.
