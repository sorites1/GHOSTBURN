# Attitude

\[Attitude\] is an NPC trait. It represents how an NPC feels about a particular person. \[Attitude\] can be thought of as a spectrum with three values: \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Friendly|Friendly]]\], \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Neutral|Neutral]]\], and \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Hostile|Hostile]]\]. Some tricks cause a target's \[Attitude\] to go improve or worsen.
