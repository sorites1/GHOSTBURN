# Encrypted Package

An \[Encrypted Package\] is a data bundle that has been protected with encryption. You cannot access the data inside an \[Encrypted Package\] unless you have the key. A key could be a password, but it could also be a unique trigger, which is a condition (or set of conditions) for automatically unlocking the data bundle. 

For example, a DateTime Trigger unlocks an \[Encrypted Package\] at a specific date and time; a Visual Trigger unlocks an \[Encrypted Package\] when an attached video device sees a preselected image, such as a particular face or pattern; and a Location Trigger unlocks an \[Encrypted Package\] only when the device on which it is stored has been moved to a particular place, such as a certain address, or even to a specific floor, room, or chair at that address. 

An \[Encrypted Package\] can be cracked by breaking the \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Security|Security]]\] that protects it. The \[Security\] of an \[Encrypted Package\] is determined by the device that encrypted the data.
