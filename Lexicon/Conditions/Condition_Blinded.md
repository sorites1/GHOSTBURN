# Blinded

**Cause:** When an attack, condition, or environmental effect prevents you from seeing, you are \[Blinded\]. This condition replaces \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Vision_Impairment|Vision Impairment]]\].

**Effect:** You cannot see. All targets have \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Total|Concealment, Total]]\] from you. Tricks with the \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Visual|Visual]]\] keyword have their DL raised by one and their outcomes \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Downgraded|Downgraded]]\]. It is not possible to even attempt an action that is exclusively dependent upon sight, such as identifying the man in the bowler hat. You gain \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Movement_Restricted|Movement Restricted]]\]. 

**Removal:** When the condition or environmental effect that caused you to be \[Blinded\] is removed, you lose the \[Blinded\] condition. In rare cases, this condition is permanent.
