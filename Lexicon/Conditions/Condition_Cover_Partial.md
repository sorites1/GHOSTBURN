# Cover, Partial

**Cause:** Your body is partly behind a solid object and partly exposed, making it harder for you to be seen by an observer or struck by an \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Attack|Attack]]\]. It is possible to have \[Cover, Partial\] to one observer and not another.

**Effect:** Attacks made against you by an observer to whom you have \[Cover, Partial\] have their DL raised by one. Attempts to locate you through sight alone have their DL raised by one. If you are hit by an attacker from whom you have \[Cover, Partial\], the damage is \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Reduced|Reduced]]\]. 

**Removal:** When you become fully visible to an observer or gain \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Total|Concealment, Total]]\] to them, you no longer have \[Concealment, Partial\] to them.
