# Servile

**Cause:** When you unnerve someone so much that they will do anything to please you, they are \[Servile]\. This condition replaces \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Compliant|Compliant]]\].

**Effect:** As long as the target is \[Servile\], they will follow your instructions and look for other ways to please you. You can give them one task to complete, and they will do it as best they can, even if it takes days.

**Removal:** To maintain the target's \[Servile\] condition, you must pay them a visit at least once a day until the task is complete. Otherwise, they lose the \[Servile\] condition. You may verbally release them from the \[Servile\] condition at any time.
