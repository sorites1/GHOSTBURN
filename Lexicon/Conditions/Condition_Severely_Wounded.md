# Severely Wounded

**Cause:** When you are reduced to half your half of your \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Wounded|Wounded]]\] value (or less) in hit points, you gain the \[Severely Wounded\] condition.

**Effect:** You gain \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Movement_Impaired|Movement Impaired]]\]. All skill actions have their DL raised by one.

**Removal:** When you have more than half your \[Wounded\] value in hit points, you lose the \[Severely Wounded\] condition. You also lose the \[Severely Wounded\] condition if you advance to \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Deaths_Door|Death's Door]]\] or \[[[Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Dying|Dying]]\].
