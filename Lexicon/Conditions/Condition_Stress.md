# Stress

**Cause:** \[Stress\] is triggered by getting a Fade on certain tricks. You can have \[Stress\] from multiple sources at once, but multiple instances of \[Stress\] from the same trick do not stack.

**Effect:** At the start of your turn, make a \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Basic|Basic]]\] roll using the trick that triggered your \[Stress\]. Use the DL identified in the trick's Fade outcome. Failure means you trigger the Glitch outcome of that trick.

**Removal:** You lose the \[Stress\] condition if you fail the \[Basic\] roll and trigger a Glitch. On your turn, if you have \[Stress\], you can try to improve the outcome by using 1 AP to roll the trick again; if you get a Success or Cool Success, you lose the \[Stress\] condition. If you have \[Stress\] when the scene ends, you lose the \[Stress\] condition.
