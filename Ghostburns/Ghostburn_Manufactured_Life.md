## Manufactured Life

You have lived in the arcology your entire life, and you have many happy memories of a childhood spent playing on the marble floors of the Great Room as your mother and father worked nearby. As an adult, you married and wanted to give your children the same wholesome experiences you had growing up. You were happy at your job working for the megacorp, and you were friendly with your coworkers. You shared in their personal and professional successes, and you were there for the births of their children. When the migraines started, you saw a doctor and got some drugs that helped for a while. But soon the headaches came back full force, along with visions, vivid flashes of what almost seemed like memories, but they were from outside the arcology in what they call the sprawl. How could that be possible? Then you started to notice strange behavior from those around you. Small things at first, people watching you when they thought you weren't looking. Whispers in the background that bore your name. You felt paranoid, like you were losing your grip on reality, and just when you felt you couldn't bear it any longer, you had your strongest vision yet. Flashes of training, mission briefing, and a sendoff in the dark of night. You didn't have all the pieces of the puzzle yet, but it was at this moment you realized your memories of the arcology were fake and so were all the people around you. But why? To prevent you from completing your mission? You felt it was important to fully recover your memories, and you feared that if you stayed, they'd drug you or do something worse, so you fled. It seemed like the world was after you that night, but somehow, you made it out. With nowhere to turn and no one you could trust, you ended up deep in the sprawl. You have more questions than answers, but at least, for now, you are free from that manufactured life.
