## Learned a Dark Secret

You learned a dark secret about your employer, something so vile that it shook you to your core. After this discovery, you were unable to return to your life and your job as if everything was normal. The knowledge you gained preyed on your mind day and night. You stopped showing up to work, and late at night, you wandered shadowy streets of the sprawl and began to frequent back alley bars and clubs, places you would never have considered entering before. What you found, once you opened yourself to the idea, was a raw kind of honesty in the people you met. These were not shining examples of citizenship, and many actually snubbed their noses at the whole, organized affair. They called it a charade, a gimmick, at best, designed to allow the megawealthy and their corporations to do whatever they want, commit whatever offenses they like, and never be held accountable. Their words rang true in your ears, and you turned the corner. Your corporate overseers noticed your absence, of course, and have likely sent a bounty hunter to "rescue" you and bring you back into the fold, but if that person ever shows up in at your door, one thing is certain: you're not going back.
