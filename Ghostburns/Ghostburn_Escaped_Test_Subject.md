## Escaped Test Subject

You led a normal life, as described by your Background Archetype, but you were subsequently kidnapped or arrested and became an unwilling test subject in a twisted experiment. Treated like a lab rat to be modified, prodded, and evaluated, you were one of hundreds, if not thousands, of people held by these diabolic captors. Perpetually drugged, your memory of the experience is hazy, and you were never able to identify their affiliation. You suspect they were megacorp scientists, but you have since heard about underground cultists and radical Gene Splicers who also engage in sick experiments like the ones you underwent. Rather than accept your fate, you plotted and waited for the right time. Somehow, you escaped and ran, fleeing into dark alleyways of the sprawl. Half deranged from the drugs and trauma of your recent experience, you hid in the rotten sewers, where you survived like an animal. After a time, you gained the courage to reintegrate yourself into society, but you are different now. You would never be able to go back to your old life.
