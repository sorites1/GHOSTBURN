# Hit Points

Your character's health is measured in hit points (hp) and is based on your Strength and Resilience scores.

All characters get 10 hp (base) and add (Strength x 3) and (Resilience x 4).

For example, a character with Strength 2 and Resilience 4 would have:

| Step | Hit Point Calculation                                     |
|:----:|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | 10 (Base) + (Strength 2 x 3) + (Resilience 4 x 4) = Maximum hit points |
| 2    | 10 (Base) + 6 + 16                                        |
| 3    | 10 (Base) + 22                                            |
| 4    | 32 hp Max                                                 |
 
To calculate your Health Levels, do the following:

| Health Level    | Hit Points           | Example with 32 hp Max |
|:----------------|:---------------------|:-----------------------|
| Healthy         | Max Hit Points       | 32 hp                  |
| Wounded         | Half of Healthy      | 16 hp                  |
| Severely Wounded| Half of Wounded      | 8 hp                   |
| Death's Door    | Half of Severely<br>Wounded | 4 hp                   |
