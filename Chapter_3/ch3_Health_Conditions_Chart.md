| **Healthy**          | When you have more than half of your maximum [[ch3_Hit_Points\|hit points]], you are healthy.                                                                                  | You are healthy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Lose at least half of your hit points.                                                                          |

| **Severely Wounded** | When you are reduced to half of your Wounded value, (or less), you gain the \[Severely Wounded\] condition. This replaces the \[Wounded\] condition.                           | You can only move once per turn. Skill actions with the \[Physical\] trait have their DL raised by one.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | When you have more than half your Wounded value in hit points, you lose the \[Severely Wounded\] condition.     |
| **Death's Door**     | When are reduced to half of your Severely Wounded value (or less), you gain the \[Death's Door\] condition. This replaces the \[Severely Wounded\] and \[Wounded\] conditions. | You are \[Prone\] and can only move by crawling once per turn. All skill actions have their DL raised by one. The first time you gain \[Death's Door\] during a scene, roll on the Injury Severity Chart.                                                                                                    | When you have more than half of your Severely Wounded value in hit points, lose the \[Death's Door\] condition. |
| **Dying**            | When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you gain the \[Dying\] condition. This replaces the \[Wounded\], \[Severely Wounded\], and \[Death's Door\] conditions.                  | You are \[Unconscious\]. You gain Dying 1. At the start of your turn, make a basic Resilience roll with a Hard (14) DL. [[ch01_27_Success\|Success]] means you gain the \[Stabilized\] condition. Failure means Dying increases by 1. When your Dying value is greater than your Resilience score, you are dead. | When you gain \[Stabilized\], you lose \[Dying\]. You have 1 hit point.                                         |
