| A person or group | Target's Wits (or the highest amongst the group) | A few minutes | \[Attitude\], \[Language\], \[Social\], \[Vocal\] |

There are two ways to think of the Entertain skill action. Ostensibly, it can be used to entertain those around you, perhaps by singing, telling a few jokes, sharing an anecdote, or even delivering a speech. In another light, this skill action allows you to present an *idea* to your listeners, asking them to entertain a certain feeling or disposition. In this way, Entertain can be used to prime the target so they are more susceptible to the next \[Social\] skill action you use on them.

| Critical Failure      | You rolled a 1 on your d20 | As Standard Failure. but you suffer an additional setback. <br><br>**Setback:** Target's \[Attitude\] towards you drops one level (from Friendly to Neutral or from Neutral to Hostile). If the target was already Hostile, they \[Break\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Standard Failure      | Lower then the DL          | The target is not entertained, and you suffer a setback. <br><br>**Setback:** You can try to use Entertain on the target again this, but the DL is raised by one. (This penalty does not stack; the DL is only raised by one regardless of how many times you get a Standard Failure or Critical Failure.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Minor (6) Success     | Equals or exceeds 6        | The target is only slightly entertained, and their \[Attitude\] towards you goes up one level (from Hostile to Neutral or from Neutral to Friendly), but they might lose interest. <br><br>**Choice:** You can either **Play your cards** or **Turn on the charm**. <br><br>- If you **Play your cards**, the next \[Social\] skill action you use on the target this turn has its DL lowered by one. <br><br>- If you **Turn on the charm**, roll Entertain again with the same DL. You must take the new result, except if you get a Minor (6) success again, treat it as a Standard Failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Moderate (10) Success | Equals or exceeds 10       | The target is entertained, and their \[Attitude\] towards you becomes Friendly. The next \[Social\] skill action you use on the target this scene has its DL lowered by one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Major (14) Success    | Equals or exceeds 14       | The target is entertained, and their \[Attitude\] towards you becomes Friendly. The GM also gets a Choice. <br><br>**Choice:** The GM can choose **Hanging on every word** or **Overcome with emotion**.<br><br>- If the GM chooses **Hanging on every word**, the target is entranced by your delivery. The next \[Social\] skill action you use on the target this turn has its DL lowered by two instead of one.<br><br>- If the GM chooses **Overcome with emotion**, the target is so moved by your words that their mood is altered to match your tone. They might become angry, melancholy, reverent, nostalgic, excited, or cheery depending on your delivery. This emotional change lasts for the duration of the scene. Starting next turn, all \[Social\] skill actions you use on the target have their DL lowered by one for the remainder of the scene. |
| Severe (18) Success   | Equals or exceeds 18       | As Major (14) Success, but you receive the benefits of both **Hanging on every word** and **Overcome with emotion**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Extreme (22) Success  | Equals or exceeds 22       | As Severe (18) Success, but target is so enamored, they become your \[Ally\] for the remainder of the scene. If the target is a group, one individual from the group fills this role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
