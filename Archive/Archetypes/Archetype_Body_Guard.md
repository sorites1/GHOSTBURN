## Bodyguard

**Keywords:** \[Uncommon\], \[Professional\]

The Bodyguard spends 100% of their time with the asset, their client, whom they are contractually obligated to protect with their life. Invariably, the asset is an individual possessed of massive self importance, but they can range widely in terms of societal position, from a cocksure Vice Merchant or upstart Screen Queen to a valuable Arcology Athlete or famous Celebrity. To outsiders, the life of the Bodyguard may seem glamorous, but even those who rub shoulders with Ridgeworld's elite find the experience hollow and unfulfilling. A rare few form a friendship with the people they protect, a factor that adds meaning to the Bodyguard's life, but which is also a stark line most refuse to cross.
