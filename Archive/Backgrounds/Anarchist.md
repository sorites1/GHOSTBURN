### Anarchist

You have spent years working to undermine corporate authority and have clashed with milsec police more times than you can count.

#### Burns (Choose One)

**Accidental Detonation** - The bomb detonated while you were out. You returned to a fiery inferno, a massive, burning hole in the side of the building. The apartments around yours were destroyed, their occupants killed. Dubbed a mass murderer, you had no choice but to run. You had not intended for those people to die, but their blood is on your hands. 

**Milsec Mole** - You were betrayed. An undercover milsec agent infiltrated your circle of anarchs. Your friends are all dead now or captured, rotting behind bars or sentenced to hard labor in Spinebreak. The fact that you escaped is a testament to your survival instincts. Alone for the first time in years, you developed a new philosophy. Trust no one. Stay alive.

**Corporate Sponsor** - You were left reeling. The mysterious benefactor behind your activities was revealed to be a blood-sucking corporation. Everything you thought you'd accomplished turned to ashes in your mouth. You were a puppet, a cog in the machine you so deeply despised. Your idealism has been shattered, but you've vowed to make them pay. They will *all* pay.
