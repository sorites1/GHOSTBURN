## Keywords

Keywords act as requirements on skill actions or tell you which game elements raise or lower the Difficulty Level of a roll (though keywords themselves do not affect the DL). Some keywords, like \[[[Keyword_Attack|Attack]]\] are merely tags that are referenced by other parts of the game.

The keywords used in this game are defined below.

| Keyword            | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Absolute Damage    | \[[[Keyword_Absolute_Damage\|Absolute Damage]]\] is 1 damage. This is the absolute lowest amount of damage any \[[[Keyword_Attack\|Attack]]\] can deal where the player's \[[[Keyword_Attack\|Attack]]\] roll yielded a Fade, Success, or Cool Success before being \[[[Keyword_Downgraded\|Downgraded]]\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Admin              | You have \[[[Keyword_Admin\|Admin]]\] access to a device or system. You can perform all the same functions as an \[[[Keyword_Operator\|Operator]]\], but you also have full control and can make changes, such as performing a shutdown, locking out users, disabling alerts, modifying configurations, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Attack             | An offensive action taken against an opponent usually with the intent to harm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Auditory           | You must be able to hear to use this trick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Basic              | When the rules call for you to make a \[[[Keyword_Basic\|Basic]]\] roll they indicate the skill or ability score to use and the Difficulty Level, as well as the consequence for getting a Success or Failure. Unlike most rolls in the game, the \[[[Keyword_Basic\|Basic]]\] roll has only Success and Failure, and the text only describes one of those two outcomes (because it is the only outcome that has a consequence attached).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Close              | Represents a very short distance between you and the target. For example, the target is \[[[Keyword_Close\|Close]]\] if you are in the same room (like a living room or private office), if it would take only a few steps to reach them, or if you could reach out and touch them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Concentrate        | You must be able to focus to use this trick. Persistent loud noises, unpleasant smells, personal illness, and other odious effects raise the DL by one. If it is impossible to \[[[Keyword_Concentrate\|Concentrate]]\], the skill or trick cannot be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Contact            | A person that you know and who has a Friendly \[Attitude\] towards you and who will help you, sometimes for a fee, when you call upon them. A \[[[Keyword_Contact\|Contact]]\] is a permanent part of your character and they remain available to you as a resource from one mission to the next. You can call upon any given \[[[Keyword_Contact\|Contact]]\] no more than once per session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Counterattack      | A special kind of \[[[Keyword_Reaction\|Reaction]]\] triggered by some tricks and allows you to immediately \[[[Keyword_Attack\|Attack]]\] the opponent that triggered it even if it's not your turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Crashes            | When a \[[[Keyword_Vehicle\|Vehicle]]\] or \[[[Keyword_Drone\|Drone]]\] \[[[Keyword_Crashes\|Crashes]]\] it collides with an immovable object and comes to a sudden stop. If the \[[[Keyword_Vehicle\|Vehicle]]\] or \[[[Keyword_Drone\|Drone]]\] was traveling at \[[[Keyword_High_Speed\|High Speed]]\], it is totaled. If the driver was wearing a safety belt, they take 5 damage. Otherwise, they take 50 points of damage. At \[[[Keyword_Moderate_Speed\|Moderate Speed]]\], the \[[[Keyword_Vehicle\|Vehicle]]\] or \[[[Keyword_Drone\|Drone]]\] takes 30 damage or 15 damage, respectively.

| Handling           | This trait represents how easy or difficult a \[[[Keyword_Vehicle\|Vehicle]]\] or \[[[Keyword_Drone\|Drone]]\] is to control. This trait can have one of three values: Good, Average, and Bad. When you use \[Drive\] to make a precision maneuver with a \[[[Keyword_Vehicle\|Vehicle]]\] or \[[[Keyword_Drone\|Drone]]\], apply its \[[[Keyword_Handling\|Handling]]\] effect (if any). Good \[[[Keyword_Handling\|Handling]]\] lowers the DL by one level. Bad \[[[Keyword_Handling\|Handling]]\] raises the DL by one. Average \[[[Keyword_Handling\|Handling]]\] has no effect on your roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Opposed            | This trick uses an \[[[Keyword_Opposed\|Opposed]]\] roll to determine the outcome instead of the standard resolution process. You roll normally, and the GM rolls 2d10 and adds the NPC's Threat bonus. Compare your result to the GM's result. If your result is 4 or more higher than the GM's roll, it's a Cool Success. If you get 1-3 higher than the GM's roll, it is a Success. If your result is equal to the GM's roll, it's a Fade. Lower than the GM's roll and it's a Glitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Reaction           | This trick is used in response to a trigger defined in its description. When the conditions for the trigger occur, you may use this trick even if it's not your turn. \[[[Keyword_Reaction\|Reaction]]\] actions are free and do not have an AP cost. However, you can only use a number of \[[[Keyword_Reaction\|Reaction]]\] actions each turn equal to your Agility score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Scope              | A \[[[Gear_Scope\|Scope]]\] is built into or attached to a firearm. It helps you hit distant targets. An \[[[Keyword_Attack\|Attack]]\] made with this weapon is treated as one step closer. That is, for purposes of determining \[[[Keyword_Range\|Range]]\], a target that is \[[[Keyword_Far\|Far]]\] away is treated as being \[[[Keyword_Nearby\|Nearby]]\], and a target that is \[[[Keyword_Nearby\|Nearby]]\] is treated as being \[[[Keyword_Close\|Close]]\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Secret             | Some tricks give you a \[[[Keyword_Secret\|Secret]]\] when you roll a Cool Success. A \[[[Keyword_Secret\|Secret]]\] has a few uses. First, it can be used to obtain a tidbit of important or interesting information related to the topic or context of the roll that gave you the \[[[Keyword_Secret\|Secret]]\]. If the GM has information to share that would satisfy the \[[[Keyword_Secret\|Secret]]\], they can offer it to you immediately. However, you can choose to bank the \[[[Keyword_Secret\|Secret]]\] instead and spend it later. A \[[[Keyword_Secret\|Secret]]\] may be spent at any time to ask the GM one Yes/No question related to the topic or context of your original roll. The GM must answer truthfully, though they may ask you to rephrase the question. Last, you may spend a \[[[Keyword_Secret\|Secret]]\] to lower the DL of any roll regardless of whether it is related to your original roll or not. |
| Security           | \[[[Keyword_Security\|Security]]\] is a measure of how secure something is. It can be used to define the difficulty of hacking a device or system, but it can also refer to the overall defense posture of a defined area, like an office building or a region of airspace. \[[[Keyword_Security\|Security]]\] is expressed as a Difficulty Level. Retail is Easy (8), Small Corp Grade is Moderate (14), Middle Corp Grade is Hard (20), Megacorp Grade is Severe (26), and Milsec Grade is Extreme (32)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Security Alert     | A \[[[Keyword_Security_Alert\|Security Alert]]\] is issued when an intruder is detected by a device, system, or person, such as a guard calling in an alert over their comvee. In the case of a device or system, a \[[[Keyword_Security_Alert\|Security Alert]]\] is issued when a hacker is detected. It forcibly dumps the user that triggered the \[[[Keyword_Security_Alert\|Security Alert]]\] and notifies the \[[[Keyword_Admin\|Admin]]\], as well as possibly executing a lockdown process and reporting the user's physical location to the appropriate milsec personnel. When an intruder is detected at a physical location, the response varies based on its defense capabilities. A retail store will likely just autodial local law enforcement, whereas a megacorp is sure to have an array of resources and techniques it can choose from when forming its response.               |
| Silencer           | A \[[[Gear_Silencer\|Silencer]]\] is built into or attached to a firearm. It reduces the muzzle flash and noise caused by firing the weapon. Attempts to notice gunfire from this weapon have their DL raised by one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Small Item         | Represents an item small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, such as a ring, wristwatch, data disk, or comvee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Social             | This trick is used to interact with people. Unless otherwise indicated, you must be \[[[Keyword_Close\|Close]]\] to your opponent to use a \[[[Keyword_Social\|Social]]\] trick on them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Stability          | This trait represents the overall balance and mass of a \[[[Keyword_Vehicle\|Vehicle]]\] and is used to resist being pushed around on the road. \[[[Keyword_Stability\|Stability]]\] is expressed as a Difficulty Level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Stabilization DL   | Your \[[[Keyword_Stabilization_DL\|Stabilization DL]]\] is based on your Resilience score. Resilience of 5 means you have a \[[[Keyword_Stabilization_DL\|Stabilization DL]]\] of Easy (8). Resilience of 4 means you have a \[[[Keyword_Stabilization_DL\|Stabilization DL]]\] of Moderate (14). Resilience of 3 means you have a \[[[Keyword_Stabilization_DL\|Stabilization DL]]\] of Hard (20). Resilience of 2 means you have a \[[[Keyword_Stabilization_DL\|Stabilization DL]]\] of Severe (26).  Resilience of 1 means you have a \[[[Keyword_Stabilization_DL\|Stabilization DL]]\] of Extreme (32).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
