## Outcomes_old

To determine the outcome of a skill action roll, compare the result of your roll to the Difficulty Level (DL). The better the roll, the better the outcome.

| Outcome          | Your Result                | Description                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical Failure | You rolled a 1 on your d20 | A failure with two consequences                                       |
| Standard Failure | Lower then the DL          | A failure with a consequence                                          |
| Minor (6)        | Equals or exceeds 6        | A success with a consequence                                          |
| Moderate (10)    | Equals or exceeds 10       | A success                                                             |
| Major (14)       | Equals or exceeds 14       | A success with a consequence                                          |
| Severe (18)      | Equals or exceeds 18       | A success with two consequences                                       |
| Extreme (22)     | Equals or exceeds 22       | A success with two consequences and another (usually dramatic) effect |

### Consequences

Depending on the outcome of your roll, it might include an additional consequence. There are three types of consequences, as shown below

* **Setback** - An immediate negative result occurs
* **Stress** - Starts a period of uncertainty after which a negative result occurs
* **Choice** - Offers the GM or player a choice, which can be positive or negative, depending on context
