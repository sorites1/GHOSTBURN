# Skills

The **Skills** chapter provides information on individual skills, including the [[Abilities_and_Ability_Scores|ability score]] typically associated with each and guidance on setting [[Base_Difficulty_Level|Difficulty Levels]]. 

Each skill includes around six skill actions that offer rules for adjudicating specific situations. For example, the Influence skill includes the skill actions, Persuade, Improve Attitude, Haggle, Command, Intimidate Person, and Intimidate Group.
