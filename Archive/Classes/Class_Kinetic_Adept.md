## Kinetic Adept
 
Growing up, you were always just a little bit faster and stronger than the other kids. It might have helped make you popular, but you started to feel different as a teenager, more so than most. Your telekinetic abilities started to show at that time, uncontrollable at first. It made you dangerous to be around. Eventually you grew into your psionic nature and learned to channel that energy into your body and your powers. It remains one of the hardest things you’ve ever had to do.
