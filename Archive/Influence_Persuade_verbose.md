## Persuade \[Skill Action\]

| Target            | Base Difficulty Level                            | Duration      | Keywords                                          |

| A person or group | Target's Wits (or the highest amongst the group) | A few minutes | \[Attitude\], \[Language\], \[Social\], \[Vocal\] |

Using flattery, charm, and a bit of psychology, you convince the target to help you in some way, typically without offering anything in return. The target won't act against their own self-interest, and they won't agree to anything too risky or dangerous. If your request is unreasonable, the GM should raise the DL by one. For a truly outrageous request, the GM should raise the DL by two.

| Critical Failure      | You rolled a 1 on your d20 | As Standard Failure. but you suffer an additional setback. <br><br>**Setback:** Target's \[Attitude\] towards you drops one level (from Friendly to Neutral or from Neutral to Hostile). If the target was already Hostile, they \[Break\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Standard Failure      | Lower then the DL          | The target refuses to help, and you suffer a setback. <br><br>**Setback:** You can only use Persuade on this target again if something changes, such as offering something of value in exchange for help, providing compelling new information, or asking for less.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Minor (6) Success     | Equals or exceeds 6        | The target reluctantly agrees to help but asks for a small token or favor in return. <br><br>**Choice:** You can either **Agree to their terms** or **Turn on the charm**. <br><br>- If you **Agree to their terms**, work with the GM to determine what the target wants. <br><br>- If you **Turn on the charm**, roll Persuade again with the same DL. You must take the new result, except if you get a Minor (6) success again, treat it as a Standard Failure. |
| Moderate (10) Success | Equals or exceeds 10       | The target agrees to help, and their \[Attitude\] towards you becomes Friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

If the target is a group, one individual from the group performs this action.<br><br>- If the GM chooses **Here's my advice**, the target also provides you with a piece of useful information.<br><br>- If the GM chooses **Take this with you**, the target also gives you a useful item or some creds.            |
| Severe (18) Success   | Equals or exceeds 18       | As Major (14) Success, but you receive the benefits of both **Here's my advice** and **Take this with you**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Extreme (22) Success  | Equals or exceeds 22       | As Severe (18) Success, but target becomes your \[Ally\] for the remainder of the scene. If the target is a group, one individual from the group fills this role. You can try to take this NPC as a Contact (with the GM's approval). To do so, you must make another \[Persuade\] roll on the target this scene with a DL of Extreme (22) Success. If you succeed, you permanently gain the target as a Contact.                                                   |
