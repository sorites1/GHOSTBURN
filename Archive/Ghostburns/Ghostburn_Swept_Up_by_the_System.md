## Swept Up by the System

You were in the wrong place at the wrong time. When that Mil-Sec harvesting team descended on your sector of the sprawl, you got caught in their dragnet, along with a hundred or more of your neighbors. You were put onto trucks and sent to a processing compound where you were convicted and assigned to a work camp. Days later, you were being transported to your new home when a twist of fate resulted in a massive interstate pileup. You were knocked unconscious and when you came to, you realized your chains had been broken. The bodies of your fellow convicts lay broken and bloodied on the blacktop, but you didn't stop to see if they were alive. You ran, and you didn't stop running until your legs gave out. You did what you had to do to survive and keep your freedom, but now you are an escaped convict. Forced to live outside of society, you went underground and started your new life as a ghost.  
### Ghostburn

If you select Swept Up by the System as a **ghostburn**, you gain the following benefits: 

**Ability Score Boost:**
* Your **Agility** score is increased by 1
* Choose one: **Presence**, **Awareness**, **Strength**, **Intelligence**, or **Resilience**
* The selected ability score is increased by 1

**Hook:**
* You are an escaped convict and have a *Wanted* status in Mil-Sec and Politcorp databases. This status will remain in effect throughout the campaign (unless in-game events change that). If Mil-Sec forces try to identify you, the GM may invoke your *Wanted* status as a story element, something which has the potential to cause problems for your character. Plastic surgery, disguises, fake identification, and other tech can mitigate the risk of being identified.
