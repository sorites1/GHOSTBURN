## Psionic Explosion

You had a normal life. You had struggles and victories. You made friends, got into disagreements, and went about living as people do. That all changed in an instant. You were going about your day in the same way you had done hundreds of times before, but on this day, you would almost lose your life. A horrific car accident, a collapsing building, a fall from a great height, or a gas explosion, the specifics of this event are left up to you, but it was sudden and without warning, and for anyone else, it would have surely resulted in their death. But you didn't die that day. Inexplicably, you walked away without a scratch. Bewildered, uneasy, you quickly realized you were *not* immortal but that something about you was different. It had been a sudden burst of psionic energy that had protected you on that day, and your life would never be the same.
