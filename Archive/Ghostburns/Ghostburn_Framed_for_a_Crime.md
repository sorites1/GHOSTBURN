## Framed for a Crime

You were framed by someone powerful, and now you're on the run for a crime you didn't commit. Feel free to flesh out the exact nature of the crimes they pinned on you, but whatever it was, it was serious, something like, murder, embezzlement, fraud against a megacorp, or selling trade secrets. The reason you were chosen is also up to you. You may have been targeted because of some insult or slight you made (intentional or not) against a higher up, or perhaps selecting you was just a matter of convenience. When things started heating up, you were lucky enough to realize the danger you were in, and you ran. The contact you selected from your Background Archetype may have aided in your escape and provided you a place to hide. Now that you have an outstanding warrant for your arrest, life is much more complicated, and there is no going back to the way things were. If you have a family, you may have communicated with them, but it is too dangerous for them to join you on the run. Yet, you do not want to leave the city you call home. You've just decided it's time to approach that city on different terms. 
### Ghostburn

If you select Framed for a Crime as a **ghostburn**, you gain the following benefits: 

**Ability Score Boost:**
* Your **Intelligence** score is increased by 1
* Choose one: **Presence**, **Awareness**, **Agility**, **Strength**, **Intelligence**, or **Resilience**
* The selected ability score is increased by 1

**Hook:**
* There is an active warrant out for your arrest and due to the severity of the crimes, it will remain in effect throughout the campaign (unless in-game events change that). If Mil-Sec forces try to identify you, the GM may invoke the warrant as a story element, something which has the potential to cause problems for your character. Plastic surgery, disguises, fake identification, and other tech can mitigate the risk of being identified.
