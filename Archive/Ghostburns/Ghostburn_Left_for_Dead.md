## Left for Dead

You were part of a team sent on a mission to a dangerous location deep within the bowels of the sprawl. Your team arrived, met their contacts, and set up a perimeter. Everything was going fine right up until the moment it wasn't. It was a bloodbath. No one was left alive. The nature of the tragedy that struck the team is left for you to decide, but it was sudden, overwhelming, and devastating. It might have been a natural disaster, a collapsing building, or an act of mass murder. In fact, you do not know the full extent of what went wrong that day. After the dust settled and you crawled out, bloody and broken, you realized you were the only survivor. You tried to radio for help, but all of your mission comms were scrambled, and when you finally got back home, your keys no longer worked. You got picked up by a Mil-Sec Patroller for trying to sleep on the street, an encounter that revealed your status, according to official records: *Deceased*. You panicked and ran, and you ended up back where it all started, deep in the sprawl, your new home.

**Hook:**
* You are *Deceased* according to official databases. In a society that operates on identity-driven transactions, it becomes very difficult to do simple things, like buy a can of Spark, when the system thinks you're dead. Purchasing a fake identity is one way to work around this limitation.
