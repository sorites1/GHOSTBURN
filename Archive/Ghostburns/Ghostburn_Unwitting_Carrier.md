## Unwitting Carrier

When you got sick, you gave it a few days, nursed yourself and took the drugs recommended on the Net, but you didn't get any better. Over the course of a week, you got much worse and ultimately checked yourself into the hospital. The doctors and nurses ran their tests and checked the numbers. They said you would be fine, but you could tell something was off. The next thing you know, you're waking up in the concrete culvert beneath the highway. Fully dressed, all personal belongings accounted for, you started to wonder if it had been a dream. Despite the rain, you felt fine, no longer sick, so you went home and went about your life. It would be three months before the same thing happened again. You got sick, went to the hospital, and woke up in a roadside ditch. The third time you got sick, you didn't go to the hospital. That's when *they* showed up. You started seeing men and women in black suits everywhere you looked. They were following you, watching you, but they would never approach or say anything. You tried to confront them once, but they did something to you, and you woke up in a ditch. Afraid, you decided to move underground, go into hiding. You met some people with similar experiences. They said they were *carriers* of something, but none of them knew what. If it was a virus, they weren't contagious, nor were they sick, same as you. You wanted answers. You *needed* answers. Thus began your new life as a ghost.
