## Windy

**Cause:** When strong wind makes it hard to keep your balance or hit a distant target, it is \[Windy\].

**Effect:** When it is \[Windy\] and maintaining your grip or balance is important (such as while scaling a sheer surface), you must make a basic Strength or Agility roll (your choice) with a DL of Hard (14). Failure means you fall \[Prone\]. and may take falling damage (GM's discretion). When it is \[Windy\] and you make a \[Gun\] \[Attack\] against a target that is \[Far\] away, the DL is raised by one. 

**Removal:** When an area is no longer subject to strong winds, it loses \[Windy\].
