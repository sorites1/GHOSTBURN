A **soltero** is a small, single-room apartment featuring a kitchenette/bathroom combo that has a cred-operated sink and toilet, as well as an autocook for making piping hot prefab foodstuff. The living space in a soltero is large enough to accommodate a sofa, as well as a table and chairs. There is room to comfortably host a couple of guests for an evening of *Arcology Sports Live* on the vid-screen, but more than that and the room will quickly feel crowded. Most solteros come with a folding bed built into the wall to allow for more usable space during non-sleeping hours.
