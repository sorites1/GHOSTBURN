## Experimental Error

**Keywords:** \[Ultra Rare\], \[Underground\]

The Experimental Error was a test subject in an experiment gone wrong. The megacorp scientists, underground cultists, or the Gene Splicer that created the Experimental Error view the resulting mutation as an undesirable side effect to be discarded and forgotten. Rather than accept this twist of fate, the Experimental Error somehow escaped and ran, fleeing into dark alleyways and rotten sewers, where they lived and survived like an animal. The Experimental Error who is found and nurtured by an effective caregiver displays a cautious optimism about reintegrating with society, but who also recognizes that their appearance may seem horrifying to some and grotesque to others.
