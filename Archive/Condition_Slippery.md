## Slippery

**Cause:** When an area is so slick it is difficult to \[Move\] or an object is so slick it is hard to hold, it is \[Slippery\].

**Effect:** To move across a surface that is \[Slippery\], you must succeed on a basic Agility roll with a DL of Hard (14). Failure means you do not \[Move\] and instead fall \[Prone\]. To grab and hold an object that is \[Slippery\], you must succeed on a basic Agility roll with a DL of Hard (14). Failure means you drop the object. 

**Removal:** When the cause of the slickness is removed from an area or object, it loses \[Slippery\].
