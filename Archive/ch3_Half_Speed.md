| Step | \[Half-Speed\] Score Calculation                      |
|:----:|:------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Strength 2 + Agility 3 = \[Half-Speed\] score in meters |
| 2    | 2 + 3                                                 |
| 3    | 5                                                     |
| 4    | \[Half-Speed\]: 5 meters                              |
