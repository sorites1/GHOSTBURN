| Target            | Base Difficulty Level                                 | Duration      | Keywords                            |

| A person or group | Target's Fortitude (or the highest amongst the group) | A few seconds | \[Language\], \[Social\], \[Vocal\] |

When you use Intimidate, you force the target (a person or group) to follow your instructions through threats of violence, loss of income, damage to reputation, or some other unpleasantness. The target won't follow instructions that would cause pain or harm to their loved ones. 

If your instructions appear to be dangerous, the GM should raise the DL by one. For highly dangerous instructions, raise the DL by two. If your target is a small group (up to 10 people), raise the DL by one. For large groups (up to 30 people), raise the DL by two.

| Critical Failure      | You rolled a 1 on your d20 | As Standard Failure. but you suffer an additional setback. <br><br>**Setback:** Target's \[Attitude\] towards you drops one level (from Friendly to Neutral or from Neutral to Hostile). If the target was already Hostile, they \[Break\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Standard Failure      | Lower then the DL          | The target will not follow your instructions, and you suffer a setback.<br><br>**Setback:** You can only use Intimidate on this target again if something changes, such as by shifting the power dynamic, applying additional pressure, or introducing new leverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Minor (6) Success     | Equals or exceeds 6        | The target is \[Compliant\] and will follow your instructions, but your control is tenuous. <br><br>**Stress:** At the start of your turn, make a basic Presence roll using the target's Fortitude as the DL. Failure means the target loses \[Compliant\] and they \[Break\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Moderate (10) Success | Equals or exceeds 10       | The target is \[Compliant\] and will follow your instructions for the remainder of the scene as long as you remain in their vicinity. Leaving the target alone causes them to lose \[Compliant\]. A new Intimidate roll is required to maintain control over the target when moving to a new scene. The GM may require you to make additional Intimidate rolls if you escalate the situation by forcing the target to do worse or more dangerous things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Major (14) Success    | Equals or exceeds 14       | As Moderate (10) Success, but the GM also gets a Choice. <br><br>**Choice:** The GM can choose **You got it, boss** or **No babysitter needed**.<br><br>- If the GM chooses **You got it, boss**, the target becomes your \[Follower\] for the duration of the scene. You do not need to make additional Intimidate rolls to keep them \[Compliant\], even when instructing them to do worse or more dangerous things. However, if you leave their vicinity for more than one turn, the target will lose \[Compliant\] and flee.<br><br>- If the GM chooses **No babysitter needed**, the target will remain \[Compliant\] without trying to flee or stage an attack if you leave their vicinity. |
| Severe (18) Success   | Equals or exceeds 18       | As Major (14) Success, but you receive the benefits of both **You got it, boss** and **No babysitter needed**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Extreme (22) Success  | Equals or exceeds 22       | As Severe (18) Success, but target becomes your \[Ally\] for the duration of the scene. If the target is a group, one individual from the group becomes your ally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
