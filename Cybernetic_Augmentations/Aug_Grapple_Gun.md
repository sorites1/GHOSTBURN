# Grapple Gun \[Augment\]

The \[Grapple Gun\] augment can only be installed in a \[[[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Arm|Cyber Arm]]\]. When you spend 1 AP to activate it, your hand flips upward in an unnatural orientation to your wrist, and a clawed grapple extends and unfolds from the base of your palm. When you use \[Grapple Gun\] make \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Basic|Basic]]\] Firearms roll with a DL of Moderate (14). Success means your grapple finds purchase and provides you with a strong climbing cable. You can detach the climbing wire (0 AP) to allow others to more easily climb, if desired. Rather than climb, you can spend 1 AP to have the \[Grapple Gun\] rewind its cable, hoisting you up in the process. You can carry one person with you when you do this. It costs 1 AP to stow your grapple.
