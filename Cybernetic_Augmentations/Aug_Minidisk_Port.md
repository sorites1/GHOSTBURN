It costs 1 AP to interact with a data cartridge, such as to insert or remove it from Minidisk Port, and it costs 1 AP to transfer data to or from a cartridge inserted into Minidisk Port.

Minidisk Port has no extra capabilities on its own, and it is designed to use the other augments you have installed that can act as sources of data. For example, the [[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Comms|Comms]]. [[Aug_Cybernetic_Eye|Cybernetic Eyes]] and [[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Datajack|Datajack]] augments could each serve as a source of data to be transferred to a cartridge with Minidisk Port. 

By default, data transferred onto a cartridge using Minidisk Port is converted into an \[Encrypted Package\] and is readable only by you. When you convert a Data Bundle into an \[Encrypted Package\], you must assign a password or create a unique trigger, as described in \[[[Keyword_Encrypted_Package|Encrypted Package]]\]. The \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Security|Security]]\] used to encode the \[Encrypted Package\] is based on the Minidisk Port level. Minidisk Port (Level 1): Easy (8), Minidisk Port (Level 2): Moderate (14), Minidisk Port (Level 3): Hard (20), Minidisk Port (Level 4): Severe (26).
