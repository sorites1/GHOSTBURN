# CAT Reflexes

The \[CAT Reflexes\] augment, which is attached to the spinal column and brain stem, increases bodily speed and improves reaction time. CAT stands for Celerity Actuating Transducer. This augment converts neural signals from the brain into faster motor responses in the body. \[CAT Reflexes\] comes in three levels: \[CAT Reflexes 1\], \[CAT Reflexes 2\], and \[CAT Reflexes 3\]. These levels represent an upgrade path; they do not stack.
