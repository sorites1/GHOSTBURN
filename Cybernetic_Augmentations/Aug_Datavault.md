# Datavault

The \[Datavault\] augment works in conjunction with other augments capable of accessing data, like \[[[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Comms|Comms]]\], \[[[Mod_Video_Recoder|Video Recorder]]\], \[[[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Datajack|Datajack]]\], and \[[[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Minidisk|Minidisk]]\]. Spend 1 AP to transfer data into your \[Datavault\]. When special data bundles known as \[Encrypted Packages\] are transferred into your \[Datavault\], they are automatically placed in hidden partitions. No one can access these \[Encrypted Packages\] without the proper key, not even you. 

When you transfer data bundles into your \[Datavault\], you can choose to convert them into \[Encrypted Packages\]. When you do this, you must set a different kind of key, such as time key (where the data becomes accessible after a particular data and time), a visual key (where the data unlocks when you see a particular face, for example), or a location key (where the data unlocks only when you travel to a particular place).

All data stored in your \[Datavault\] is protected by \[Security\], as shown below. \[Datavault\] comes in three levels: \[Datavault 1\], \[Datavault 2\], and \[Datavault 3\]. These levels represent an upgrade path; they do not stack.
