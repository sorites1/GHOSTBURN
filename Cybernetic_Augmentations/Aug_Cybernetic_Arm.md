# Cybernetic Arm

A \[Cybernetic Arm\] is a full replacement of one of your existing arms. One \[Cybernetic Arm\] can improve your Strength, and two can increase your Strength more. You may improve your character's natural Strength by spending XP as normal. \[Cybernetic Arm\] comes in four levels: \[Cybernetic Arm 0\], \[Cybernetic Arm 1\], \[Cybernetic Arm 2\], and \[Cybernetic Arm 3\]. These levels represent an upgrade path; they do not stack. A \[Cybernetic Arm\] of one level is \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Incompatible|Incompatible]]\] with a \[Cybernetic Arm\] of another level (only the lower of the two levels is applied). You can install up to 4 Mesh worth of augments into a Cybernetic Arm without paying the Mesh Cost of those augments.
