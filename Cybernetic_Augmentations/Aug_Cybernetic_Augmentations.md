# Cybernetic Augmentations

Characters in **GHOSTBURN 2325** can get cybernetic augmentations installed in their body. 

## Mesh

You have an attribute called **Mesh** which represents the limit on how much cybernetics you can cram in your body. All characters have a Mesh of 10, plus their Strength score, plus their Resilience score. For example, a character with a Strength score of 3 and a Resilience score of 2 has a Mesh of 15 (10 + 3 + 2). 

### Mesh Cost

Cybernetic augmentations have a cost in creds, as well as a a Mesh cost. You add up the Mesh cost for all of the augments you have to determine the total Mesh cost. Then you compare that value to your character's Mesh attribute. Your Mesh cost cannot exceed your Mesh attribute. 

## Cred Cost

The cost in cred for each piece of cyberware is equal to (Mesh Cost x Cyberware Level x 10,000). Cyberware that does not have a level is considered level 1 for purposes of this calculation. For example, a Datajack has a Mesh Cost of 1, so it costs 10,000 cred. Wired Reflexes 3, on the other hand, has a Mesh Cost of 14 (and it's level 3), so it costs 420,000 cred (14 x 3 x 10,000).

### Data/Comm Implants

These are implants used for data storage, processing, transfer, or communication.
