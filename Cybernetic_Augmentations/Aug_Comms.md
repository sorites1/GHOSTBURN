# Comms

The \[Comms\] augment is implanted behind either ear, at the base of the skull. This tech array is used to access the the Net for communications, maps, and audio/video content, including calls, radio communications, music, entertainment, stock prices, live broadcasts, and weather alerts. This augment also grants the ability to share data with and to stream audio and video to and from other \[Comms\] users, with their consent. When speaking through \[Comms\], you may do so silently by forming the words with your tongue in your mouth (while keeping your lips closed).
