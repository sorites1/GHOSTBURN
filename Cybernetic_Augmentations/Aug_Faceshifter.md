# Faceshifter \[Augment\]

*When Faceshifter is installed, your natural face is scraped away, and a series of actuator-driven ceramic plates are mounted to the underlying bone. The entire assembly is overlayed with a NanoWeave mesh, a blank canvas for any new face you might desire.*

When you use Faceshifter, spend 1 AP as you take a moment to examine a face you can clearly see (in person, in a photo, or in a video). The augment is capable of producing different facial shapes, skin tones, scars, birthmarks, and blemishes, and it can even sprout synthetic hair to produce a mustache, beard, razor stubble, and the like. However, it cannot recreate symbols or artwork. 

While you are wearing a face, you may store it as your "default" in the Faceshifter augment. You may only store one face at a time, and if you store a new face, it overwrites the previous one. You can shift to and from your default face for free (0 AP), even if it's not your turn.

An NPC who becomes \[[[Conditions/Condition_Suspicous|Suspicious]]\] of you makes a \[Basic\] Threat roll to recognize that your face is cybernetic. The DL for this roll is based on the augment's level. Faceshifter 1: \[Suspicious\] NPCs roll Threat vs. Moderate (14), Faceshifter 2: \[Suspicious\] NPCs roll Threat vs. Hard (20), and Faceshifter 3. \[Suspicious\] NPCs roll Threat vs. Severe (26).
