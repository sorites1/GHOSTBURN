# Faceshifter

When the \[Faceshifter\] augment is installed, your natural face is scraped away, and a series of actuator-driven plates are mounted to the underlying bone. The entire assembly is overlayed with nanoweave, a blank canvas for a new face.

When you use \[Faceshifter\], spend 1 AP as you take a moment to examine a face you can clearly see (in person, in a photo, or in a video). Make a \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Basic|Basic]]\] Insight roll with a DL of Easy (8). Success means \[Faceshifter\] replicates that face. The augment is capable of producing different skin tones, scars, birthmarks, and blemishes, and it can even sprout synthetic hair to produce a mustache, beard, razor stubble, and the like. However, it cannot recreate symbols or artwork. 

While you are wearing a face, you may store it as your "default" in the \[Faceshifter\] augment. You may only store one face at a time, and if you store a new face, it overwrites the previous one. You can shift to and from your default face for free (0 AP), even if it's not your turn.

An NPC who becomes \[[[Conditions/Condition_Suspicous|Suspicious]]\] of you makes a \[Basic\] Threat roll to recognize that your face is cybernetic. The DL for this roll is based on the level of \[Faceshifter\], as shown below. \[Faceshifter\] comes in three levels: \[Faceshifter 1\], \[Faceshifter 2\], and \[Faceshifter 3\]. These levels represent an upgrade path; they do not stack.
