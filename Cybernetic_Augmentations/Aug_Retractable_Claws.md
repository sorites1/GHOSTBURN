# Retractable Claws

The \[Retractable Claws\] augment is implanted in the lower forearm and top of the hand. When activated, three short blades extend from slots in the top of the hand. Together, these three claws act as a \[[[Melee_Weapons/Melee_Combat_Knife|Combat Knife]]\] but it uses \[Brawl\] rather than \[Melee\]. You can extend and retract the \[Retractable Claws\] for free (0 AP).
