# Cybernetic Eyes

\[Cybernetic Eyes\] are eyes come in two varieties: cybernetically modified eyes and replacement eyes. 

* **Cybernetically Modified Eyes** means the person retains their natural eyes, but they are surgically altered to gain the benefits of augmentation. 
* **Replacement Eyes** means the person has had their natural eyes removed (or they might have been lost due to injury) and replaced with obvious \[Augmented Eyes\].

The only difference between these two types of \[Cybernetic Eyes\] is the cost and the appearance.

\[Cybernetic Eyes\] come in three levels: Cybernetic Eyes 1, Cybernetic Eyes 2, and Cybernetic Eyes 3. Each level is an upgraded version of the prior level; they do not stack. Vision Mods must be purchased separately and installed using \[[[Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Medicine_Cybernetic_Installation|Cybernetic Installation]]\].
