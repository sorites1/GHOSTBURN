## Investigator

In the sprawl, the truth is often ugly, uncomfortable, and meticulously concealed by people and megacorps alike. But for the right amount of cred, you're willing to go digging for it. When a mystery presents itself, you apply your skills, knowledge, and investigative process to ascertain the facts. You are a professional, but you are also drawn to this life. Something compels you to seek out the answers to dark questions no matter where they're hiding.
