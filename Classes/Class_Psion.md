## Psion

Your powers make you different. You might have been born this way and naturally exhibited psionic talent from a young age. More likely, your abilities were unlocked by a traumatic event, such as a near-death experience, a moment of great vulnerability, or the feeling of intense heartbreak. Megacorps are keen to capitalize on individuals such as yourself, and they pour trillions into psi research every year. Regular citizens who show signs of psionic talent are snatched up by the corps, sometimes willingly and sometimes not, and are trained to become soldiers or spies. You've chosen a different path, and you'll die before you become anyone's test subject.
