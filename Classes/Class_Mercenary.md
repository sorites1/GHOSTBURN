## Mercenary

You cut your teeth on a tour of duty that saw plenty of combat. You might have signed up to defend gas miners from pirate gangs in Spinebreak, served in the Spanish Marines and fought against the drug lord's armies, or were recruited by one of the megacorps to fight in the Eternal War. Your experiences shaped you into the soldier of fortune you are today. You might have a rule or two, certain lines you're not willing to cross, but at the end of the day, you're a hired gun willing to accept most any mission if the cred is right.
