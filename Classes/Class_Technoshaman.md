## Technoshaman

You are naturally tapped into the psionic resonance that exists between you and objects in the world, whether technological or inert. To put it another way, objects speak to you, and you can often convince them to do as you say. Inert objects can only tell you what they know from the past. Tech devices, on the other hand, are possessed by either a *sprite* or a *daemon*, and dealing with each has its quirks. To you, it seems irrelevant whether these digital spirits are real or just a figment of your mind. The proof, as they say, is in the results.
