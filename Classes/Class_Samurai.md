## Samurai

You wield your blade and gun in service to a warrior code. You might have once been loyal to a corporate boss, Yakuza *oyabun*, or another master who paid for all the chrome in your body, but those days are in the past. You are a samurai of the streets, a bold and deadly foe to anyone who dares cross you. Your reputation is built not just on your lethality but also your sense of honor and your code.
