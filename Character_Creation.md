# Character Creation

In this game, each player creates a character to play. As the player, you make all the decisions about your character, including their Background, their natural Abilities, learned Skills, and so on. 

To create a character in ***GHOSTBURN 2325***, follow the steps below.

1. Choose a **Background Archetype** - A defining element of your past
2. Choose a **Ghostburn** - The catalyst, the reason, you left your old life behind
3. Choose a **Class** - Your new life as a ghost, a deniable asset who works in the shadows
4. Choose a **Specialization** - The path you have chosen

## Step 1: Choose a Background Archetype

Browse the list of Archetypes and read the **Background** section of each one to understand what it offers. Each Background Archetype grants: 

* An ability score increase
* The rank of Trained in one skill
* A +1 bonus to one skill action in that skill
* Access to one Contact Archetype

You may only select one Background Archetype during character creation. 

Once selected, read the **Contact** section of the three Contact Archetypes offered by the Background. The Contact section describes what **Knowledge** the person can provide, the **Resources** they might offer, and what they expect in return (**Quid Pro Quo**). 

Each entry also includes an **NPC** section, which includes sample stats to allow the GM to drop the NPC Archetype into the story, as needed.

## 2. Choose a Burn (or Create Your Own)
