# Character Creation

In this game, each player creates a character to play. As the player, you make all the decisions about your character, including their background, natural abilities, skills, and so on. 

To create a character in ***GHOSTBURN 2325***, follow the steps below.

## 1. Ability Scores

A character's ability scores describe their natural abilities, such as their strength and intelligence. The higher the score, the greater the ability. Scores range from 0 to 5. Ability scores (except Resilience and Psi) can be increased beyond the natural limit of 5 through cybernetic augmentation.

| Ability Score | Ability Level | Description                                       |
| :-----------: | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
|       0       | Incapable     | Totally non-functional, disabled                  |
|       1       | Feeble        | Barely capable, like a small child                |
|       2       | Average       | Human average, sufficient for most things in life |
|       3       | Impressive    | A step up from most people, competent and capable |
|       4       | Exceptional   | Better than most, a serious contender             |
|       5       | Peak Human    | The best of the best                              |

Your character has six ability scores (or seven, if you want your character to have psionic powers). 

| Ability Name | Description                                                      |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presence     | Force of personality, social awareness, and artistic ability     |
| Agility      | Quickness, nimbleness, balance, hand-eye coordination            |
| Strength     | Physical strength, general athleticism                           |
| Awareness    | Ability to sense surroundings, social insight, abstract thinking |
| Intelligence | Education, reasoning, logic, general knowledge                   |
| Resilience   | Bodily fortitude, health, and willpower                          |
| Psi          | Raw psionic talent                                               |

You get **17 points** to distribute between your abilities. Each ability score must be at least 1 (except for Psi, which can remain at 0). Only one ability score can be set to 5. If you want your character to have psionic powers, you must at least have a Psi of 1.

You will be given the opportunity to raise your ability scores later, once you have played and earned XP. If you start the game with a Psi of 1 or higher, you can raise your Psi score later (up to a maximum of 5), but if you start the game with a Psi of 0, you cannot purchase it.
