# Difficulty Level

Each Difficulty Level includes a number in parenthesis. When you use a skill action, you roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability score. Then you compare the result to that number to determine success or failure. 

For example, Easy (6) means the action is easy to do and requires you to roll against a 6. If the result is a 6 or higher, your character succeeds.
## Setting the Base Difficulty Level

Each skill action includes an entry for Difficulty Level, which determines how easy or difficulty it is to execute. A skill action's DL can be based on one of the target's ***traits*** or it may refer you to a ***chart*** included in the skill action description. A few skill actions have a ***static*** DL.  
### Traits

Some skill actions use an opponent's trait as the Difficulty Level. For example, Persuade uses the target's Wits, and Ghost Trace uses the target system's Security trait.

Traits are only found in stat blocks for the opposition, never in player-characters, and they are expressed as Difficulty Levels. For example, Rico the food cart vendor has a Wits of Moderate (10), and the local Food Mart's payment system has a Security of Hard (14).
#### Difficulty Level Chart

Sometimes, the GM is responsible for setting the base DL. As the GM, use your common sense, along with the guidance provided in the DL chart of the skill actions that use it to set a Difficulty Level.
### Adjusting the Difficulty Level

Before making a roll, adjust the base Difficulty Level of the task by taking relevant qualities, conditions, and enhancements into account.

#### Qualities

Qualities are short, freeform descriptors that are not specifically defined by the game's rules. A quality is an aspect of a person, place, or thing. When the GM calls for a roll, each quality relevant to the situation raises or lowers the Difficulty Level.

For example, Rico the food cart vendor has the quality, \[Needs the
Money\]. Qualities like this can help inform the GM's roleplaying and
decision making. A quality like \[Needs the Money\] means the character
probably prioritizes their income and savings over other aspects of
their life. They are likely to be thrifty or even penny-pinching.

Places and things can have qualities too. A night club might have the
qualities, \[Loud\], \[Dark\], and \[Packed\], or a wooden door could
have the quality, \[Solid Oak\], which speaks to its sturdiness and
difficulty to break down.

The same quality can raise one Difficulty Level while lowering another.
For example, the quality \[Dark\] makes it harder to scan the room and
find your friends, so it would raise the DL by one. On the other hand,
if you are trying to hide, the \[Dark\] is a benefit, so it would lower
the DL by one.

Qualities are added and removed as appropriate. For example, during the
day, when the maintenance crew is working, the night club no longer has
the qualities \[Dark\], \[Loud\], or \[Packed\] because the lights are
on, there's no music, and only a handful of workers are present.

#### Conditions

Conditions are temporary effects on people and are codified by these
rules. Distracted, Off Balance, and Hidden are examples of conditions
that could affect your character. Descriptions of each condition,
including how they affect your character, how long they last, and how to
get rid of them, can be found later in this book. As with qualities,
conditions can raise or lower Difficulty Levels, but they usually have
other effects as well.

#### Attitude

Using social skill actions on someone with a Hostile Attitude toward you
raises the Difficulty Level, and someone with a Friendly Attitude lowers
the Difficulty Level.

#### Enhancements

Weapons and gear often include (or can be modified to support) specific
features that raise or lower Difficulty Levels under specific
circumstances. For example, a weapon with recoil compensation lowers the
Difficulty Level of all attacks made with it. Goggles or cyber eyes with
low light vision balance the Difficulty Level of skill actions that
would otherwise be made more difficult in low light. These effects,
whether from a weapon, piece of gear, or cybernetic modification, are
collectively known as enhancements.

### Adjusting Difficulty Level: Step-by-Step

Adjusting the Difficulty Level of a roll is a joint activity carried out
by the GM and the player, together.

| 1    | The player states what their character wants to do.                                                | Player: *My character is trying to convince her landlord, Josie, to buy her a hot Cup-O-Kaffe.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2    | The GM identifies the skill action to use, as well as the base Difficulty Level (DL) for the roll. | GM: *OK, that's Persuade, and you'll roll that with Presence. Persuade uses the target's Wits as the Difficulty Level, and Josie's Wits is Moderate (10), so that's the base DL for your roll.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3    | The GM announces each modifier that raises the DL. See the **Exceeding Extreme (22)** sidebar.     | GM: *Josie’s Attitude is currently \[Neutral\] towards you, so that doesn’t change anything, but she also has three qualities: \[Loves Dogs\] – which doesn’t apply here – and \[Needs the Money\] –   which does. She’s also got \[Grumpy\] and that applies too. That raises the Difficulty Level two times (once for \[Needs the Money\] and once for \[Grumpy]\). So, the Difficulty Level goes from Moderate (10) to Severe (18).* |
| 4    | The player announces each modifier they have that lowers the Difficulty Level.                     | Player: *My character has a pheromone implant, which lowers  the DL on Persuade rolls. So, that drops it back down from Severe (18) to Hard (14).*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5    | The player rolls and adds their character’s ability score.                                         | Player: *So, I roll a d20 and add my Presence score, which is 4. I rolled an 11. Adding 4, I have a result of 15.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6    | Resolve the roll by comparing the result to the Difficulty Level.                                  | Player: *I got a 15. The DL was Hard (14), so I succeeded! I get a free Cup-O-Kaffe!*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7    | The GM affirms the resolution.                                                                     | GM: *Josie looks at you and says, “You know, I don’t usually do this, but sure, you look like you could use it..”*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Exceeding Extreme (22)

As you layer on more and more modifiers, you may find yourself going past Extreme (22). When this happens, keep going and refer to extra levels as Extreme (+1), Extreme (+2), etc.

For example, consider a character who is making an attack against a target.

- For this attack, the skill action dictates the base DL is Moderate (10).
- The GM says the target is at long range.
- Each range increment beyond short raises the DL by one.
- Going from short to medium range raises the DL to Hard (14).
- Going from medium to long range raises the DL to Severe (18).
- The GM adds \[Dark\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (22).
- The GM adds \[Rain\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (+1).

After the GM finishes raising the DL, proceed with lowering the DL according to modifiers identified by the player. If the player is unable to reduce the DL to Extreme (22) or lower, then what they are trying to do is not possible. You cannot make a roll if the DL is Extreme (+1) or higher.
