## Instantiation Points

You get a number of Instantiation Points (IP) which you will use to buy features for your character. The number of IP you get depends on the type of game the group is going to play.

New GMs and players are recommended to use *Ghost - Standard Gameplay*, which grants 10 IP to spend on features for your character. 

The group should have a discussion before players create their characters to ensure everyone is on the same page. It's important for everyone to share in their understanding and expectations of the game to come.
