# Round Robin: The Flow of the Game

This game uses a round robin turn-taking style for all scenes and actions, including those in combat and out of combat. In fact, *this game makes no distinction between combat and non-combat turns*.

It is possible for some players to be in combat while other players are not. This does not alter the turn order. The game will always proceed in a round robin manner, even if that means you end up with a mix, such as, one player takes a turn in combat, the next player takes a turn *outside of combat*, and the last player takes a turn *in a different combat*.

This game is designed to allow players to have their characters act independently from one another without forcing anyone to "sit out" until one group's actions have been resolved. Instead, this game blends everyone's actions together in an orderly way by requiring everyone to
take turns.

## The Turn Order

Each time your group assembles, whether online or in person, to play the game, the GM will start by setting the stage, reminding everyone of the events of last session, and so on. Play begins with the player to the GM's left. They describe what their character does, and the GM responds accordingly. Then, play proceeds to the left and the next player takes a turn, and so on, until everyone has taken a turn, and play comes back to the GM.

## Your Turn

On your turn, you tell the GM what you want your character to do. You can also ask questions of the GM or other players, whether their characters are with you or not. While in-game actions and dice rolls are shared openly, players are expected to keep their characters' knowledge separate. Just because you heard it, doesn't mean your character did.

## Types of Turns

There are three types of turns in this game:

- **Regular Turn** -- A regular turn typically involves narration and may include the use of a few skill actions. You might describe your character doing something dangerous like sneaking into an abandoned warehouse. During your turn, the GM may call for up to three rolls, such as an Athletics roll to jump the fence, a Sneak roll to avoid notice, and a Computer roll to hack the lock. However, this is not a hard rule, and the GM is not required to call for three (or any)
  rolls. Regular turns are more unstructured and rely on both the GM and the player to regulate the amount of time spent on this turn.

- **Combat Turn --** A combat turn is strictly regimented by the use of 3 Action Points (AP). At the start of your turn, you gain 3 AP if you are in combat. You may spend your AP as you wish throughout your turn. Once all of your AP is spent, or you do not wish to spend them all,
  your turn is over. See the Combat chapter for more information on spending AP.

- **GM Turn** -- When play comes back to the GM, it signals a potential escalation. The GM can use their turn to introduce new characters into a scene, whether in combat or not. The GM should also use their turn to run the opposition against those who are in combat.

Players should generally avoid interrupting other players on their turns. However, if one player narrates an action that would directly impact another player, the GM may allow the second player to react directly before returning to the first player. Any reaction by a second player should be minimal to preserve the first player's turn.

If you are unsure of what to do on your turn, the GM may also prompt you with a question or two to help you identify possible actions your character could take. However, you are not required to take an action on your turn. You may pass.

## Group Turns

When the group is partially or completely together in the same place at the same time, the GM is free to drop individual turns in favor of group turns. Group turns offer a loose, collaborative segment in which players share their ideas and narrate their character's actions without a formal
turn order. This is a great time to let the players show off their characters' personalities and quirks, and it lets them roleplay with one another.

Group turns are especially useful when time is compressed or actions are routine, such as when traveling across the city, which could take a couple of hours or more. If players prefer to stay in the round robin turn order during group scenes, that is perfectly fine. Some players may want the opportunity to narrate what their character is doing during this moment of downtime.

Anyone not part of these group turns should still be given their individual turns, whether regular or combat.
