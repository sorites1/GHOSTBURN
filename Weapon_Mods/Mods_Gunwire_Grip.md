# Gunwire Grip

A \[Gunwire Grip\] is built into or attached to the grip of a firearm. This weapon mod grants a +2 \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Gear_Bonus|Gear Bonus]]\] to Firearms, but only if the wielder has the \[[[Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Gunwires|Gunwires]]\] augment. 

A \[Gunwire Grip\] can be configured so the firearm is locked and unusable by anyone except for those with authorized biometrics.
