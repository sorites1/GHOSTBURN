# Core Mechanic

When a player describes what their character is doing, the GM first determines if a roll is necessary. If the task is trivial, impossible, or carries no risk, such that a character could keep trying until they were successful, then it is not necessary to roll.

| Task       | Resolution              | Examples                       |
|:-----------|:------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Trivial    | You succeed             | Open a door<br>Make a phone call<br>Log on to the Net |
| Impossible | You cannot attempt      | Jump over a house<br>Run across water<br>Access cyberspace without jacking in |
| No Risk    | Keep trying until you succeed | Climb over a small fence<br>Navigate to an unfamiliar destination<br>Repair a piece of broken equipment |

It's important to realize that the same task can be performed automatically when there is no risk but requires a roll when there is. For example, climbing over a small fence is relatively easy to do but still requires some effort. All else being equal, a character could keep trying until they succeed; no need to roll. However, that same task requires a roll if we introduce risk. 

For example, a character is being chased and rounds the corner to see a small fence blocking their path. Now, if the character decides to go over the fence, the GM should have the player roll, even if the task is easy, because failure leads to consequences (the pursuers catch up).

## Making a Roll

When the GM determines that a roll is necessary, they identify the skill and ability score for the player to use, as well as the Difficulty Level of the task. Difficulty Levels range from Automatic (2) to Extreme (22).

The player then rolls a d20 and adds the appropriate [[03. Abilities and Ability Scores|ability score]] to get the result. 

If the result equals or exceeds the Difficulty Level, the character succeeds (and may have critically succeeded). If the result is less than the target number, the character fails (and may have critically
failed).

## Difficulty Level

Difficulty Level indicates how easy or hard it is to succeed on a task. Each Difficulty Level includes a number in parenthesis behind the name. There are six Difficulty Levels in this game: Automatic (2), Easy (6), Moderate (10), Hard (14), Severe (18), and Extreme (22).

| Attempting something... | Difficulty Level |
|:------------------------|:-----------------|
| Trivial                 | Automatic (2)    |
| Minor                   | Easy (6)         |
| Standard                | Moderate (10)    |
| Major                   | Hard (14)        |
| Massive                 | Severe (18)      |
| Monumental              | Extreme (22)     |
