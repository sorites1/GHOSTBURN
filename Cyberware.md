## Cyberware

Characters in **GHOSTBURN 2325** can get body augmentations known as cyberware. 

## Mesh

You have an attribute called **Mesh** which represents the limit on how much cyberware you can cram in your body. All characters have a Mesh of 10, plus their Resilience score. For example, a character with a Resilience score of 2 has a Mesh of 12 (10 + 2). 

## Cyberware Cost

Cyberware has a cost in creds but also has a Mesh cost. You add up the Mesh cost for all of the cyberware you have installed to determine the total Mesh cost. Then you compare that value to your character's Mesh attribute. Your Mesh cost cannot exceed your Mesh attribute.
