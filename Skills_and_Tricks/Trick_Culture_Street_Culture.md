*You know where to go and what to do to survive on the street.* 

When you use Street Culture, you ask the GM a question related to gangs (colors, territory, leadership, factions), squatting, scavenging, stealing, and drugs. For example, *Where is the nearest homeless camp* or *Do I recognize those gang colors? What do I know about the Sick Vultures gang?*
