*You use special tools and materials to fabricate a forgery designed to fool people into thinking it's the real thing.*

When you use Forgery, you use \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Tools|Tools]]\] and \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Advanced_Supplies|Advanced Supplies]]\] to create a replica of a mundane, non-electronic object. This trick takes an hour to complete. Replicating an object that is intricate or expensive raises the DL by one and takes 24 hours to complete, though those hours need not be consecutive.
