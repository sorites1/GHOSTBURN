*You blast away with two guns, one in each hand.* 

To use Dual Shot, you must be equipped with two identical pistols or two identical SMGs, one in each hand. 

If your weapons have different mods, they can all be used when you make your roll, though the rules on stacking bonuses still apply. Refer to [[PtG_Making_a_Roll|Making a Roll]] for more information. 

You may target the same opponent or two different opponents who are \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Nearby|Nearby]]\] to one another. If at least one target is at a \[Range\] other than your weapons' \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Optimal_Range|Optimal Range]]\], raise the DL by one. 

When you use \[Dual Shot\], make only one roll and use only one \[Damage Array\]. If your weapons have a Single Shot \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Damage_Array|Damage Array]]\] you may use it to calculate damage. If your weapons have a Burst Fire \[Damage Array\], you may use it instead, but doing so raises the DL by one, and you must declare your intent to use Burst Fire prior to making your roll. Both weapons must use the same mode, Single Shot or Burst Fire.
