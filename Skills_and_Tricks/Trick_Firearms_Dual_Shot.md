*You blast away with two guns, one in each hand.* 

To use Dual Shot, you must be equipped with two pistols or SMGs. You may target the same opponent or two different opponents who are \[[[Keyword_Nearby|Nearby]]\] to one another. Your opponent(s) must be at your weapons' \[[[Keyword_Optimal_Range|Optimal Range]]\]. If at least one opponent is at a different range, raise the DL by one. When you use \[Dual Shot\], make only one roll and use only one \[Damage Array\]. If your weapons have a Single Shot \[[[Keyword_Damage_Array|Damage Array]]\] you may use it to calculate damage. If your weapons have a Burst Fire \[Damage Array\], you may use it instead, but doing so raise the DL by one, and you must declare your intent to use Burst Fire prior to making your roll. Both weapons must use the same mode, Single Shot or Burst Fire.
