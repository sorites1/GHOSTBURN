*You know that beneath the glitz and glam of the city lies a thriving and dangerous underworld.* 

When you use Underworld Culture, you ask the GM a question related to organized crime, including the Mafia, Yakuza, and Jo-Pok. For example, an encounter with the Yakuza may make you wonder, *What interest does the Yakuza have in Knifepoint Capital?* or *Who is in charge of the Yakuza in this city?* The scope of this trick is limited to information about organized criminal enterprise, organization hierarchy and membership, and areas of influence.
