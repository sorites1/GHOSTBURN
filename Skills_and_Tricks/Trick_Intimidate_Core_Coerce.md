## Coerce \[Core Trick\]

| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill      | Keywords                            |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Fort                  | Intimidate | \[[[Keyword_Language\|Language]]\], \[[[Keyword_Social\|Social]]\], \[[[Keyword_Vocal\|Vocal]]\] |

*With threats of damage to income, reputation, or bodily health, you force your victim to comply with your instructions.* 

If your instructions would put the target or their loved ones in a dangerous situation, raise the DL by one. They will outright refuse instructions that would result in certain death or serious injury.
