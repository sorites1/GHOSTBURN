# Skills and Tricks

There are fifteen skills in this game, three for each of the core five [[Abilities_and_Ability_Scores|abilities]] (Presence, Awareness, Agility, Intelligence, and Strength). For example, the three skills associated with Agility are Drive, Firearms, and Stealth.

If your character knows a skill, it will have a [[Keyword_Skill_Bonus|skill bonus]] ranging from +1 to +3. When you [[Making_a_Roll|make a roll]] with a skill, you add your skill bonus and the skill's primary ability score to the roll. 

The skills in this game include rules for [[Keyword_Trick|tricks]], which are specific uses of a skill. For example, the Medicine skill includes a trick called First Aid and another called Surgery.

Tricks are categorized as being either [[Keyword_Core_Trick|core tricks]] or [[Keyword_Signature_Trick|signature tricks]]. Anyone may use core tricks, even if they have no skill bonus, but you can only use a signature trick if your character knows it.

When a player wants to try something not covered by the rules, the GM can allow them to perform an [[Keyword_Improvised_Trick|improvised trick]].
