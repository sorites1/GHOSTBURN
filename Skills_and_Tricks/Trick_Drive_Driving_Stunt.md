*When you're behind the wheel, you are capable of pulling off daring high-speed stunts that threaten to break the laws of physics.* 

To use this trick, you must be driving a \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle|Vehicle]]\] at \[[[Keywords/Keyword_High_Speed|High Speed]]\] (but this does not raise the DL as it normally would). When you use Driving Stunt, state your desired outcome, such as *I want to jump the draw bridge while it's opening* or *I want to tilt my car so it's almost on its side and I can go through a narrow alley.* If you only use \[[[Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand|One Hand]]\] with Driving Stunt, raise the DL by one.

| Fade         | You get the desired outcome but your \[Vehicle\] takes 5 damage                                                     |
| Glitch       | You lose control of your \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle\|Vehicle]]\] and it \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Crashes\|Crashes]]\] |
