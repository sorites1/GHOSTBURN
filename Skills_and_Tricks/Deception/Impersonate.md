*By altering your voice, facial expressions, and even the way you sit or stand, you convincingly impersonate another person.*

You can use Impersonate to trick someone into thinking you are someone else. If you have only verbal communication with your opponent, you can trick them with Impersonate alone. However, if you want to impersonate someone in the presence of others, you also need to use Disguise. If you got a Cool Success on your Disguise roll, lower the DL for Impersonate by one.
