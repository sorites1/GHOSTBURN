You have no home. You live by scavenging and begging for food. You sleep where you can find shelter. You live on the street long enough, and you learn which spots are better than others. In Ridgeworld, you live among the dregs in the lowest part of the city, down near the pumps that constantly run to keep the tidewaters away.
