# Damage Array

All weapons (including unarmed attacks made with the Brawl skill) express damage as a **damage array**.

A \[Damage Array\] holds three values separated by slashes, like this: 5/10/25. These values correspond to the damage dealt on a Fade, Success, or Cool Success, respectively. The first number is \[Minimum Damage\]. The second is \[Normal Damage\], and the last is \[Maximum Damage\]. See the Outcomes section under Making a Roll for more information on Fade, Success, and Cool Success.

For example, you draw your Ranco Firewalker heavy pistol and use Firearms (Single Shot) to shoot at the security guard. You make a roll and score a Fade. According to the outcomes for Single Shot, a Fade deals \[Minimum Damage\]. The damage array for your Firewalker is 9/18/45. Since the first number in the array is 9, you deal 9 points of damage to the guard.

### Firearms Damage

When you use a Firearms trick, such as Firearms (Single Shot), use the damage array provided for the weapon. For determining damage for Single Shot, \[Minimum Damage\] is equal to the weapon's Base Value. \[Normal Damage\] is its Base Value times two. \[Maximum Damage\] is its Base Value times five.

| Minimum Damage | Normal Damage  | Maximum Damage |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Base Value     | Base Value x 2 | Base Value x 5 |
For example, a weapon with a Base Value of 5 would have a \[Damage Array\] of 5/10/25.

#### Firing Modes

Weapons that have multiple firing modes have a damage array for each mode. For example, a light pistol only has a damage array for \[Single Shot\], but a PX-90 rifle has three damage arrays, one for each \[Single Shot\], \[Burst Fire\], and \[Full Auto\]. The damage array for \[Burst Fire\] and \[Full Auto\] use an adjusted Base Value to produce a damage array with higher values because the represent a larger volume of rounds. 

### Brawl Damage

When you use a Brawl trick, such as Brawl (Unarmed Strike), to make an attack, such as by punching your opponent, the \[Minimum Damage\] is equal to your Strength score. \[Normal Damage\] is your Strength score times two. \[Maximum Damage\] is your Strength score times five.

| Minimum Damage | Normal Damage | Maximum Damage |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Strength       | Strength x 2  | Strength x 5   |
For example, a character with a Strength score of 3 would have an \[Unarmed\] \[Damage Array\] of 3/6/15.

### Melee Damage

When you use a Melee trick, such as Melee (Melee Strike), to attack with a melee weapon, such as a club or knife. the weapon's damage is based on your Strength score, plus the melee weapon's Base Value. The \[Minimum Damage\] is equal to your Strength score, plus the weapon's Base Value. \[Normal Damage\] is \[Minimum Damage\] times two, and \[Maximum Damage\] is your \[Minimum Damage\] times five.

| Minimum Damage        | Normal Damage               | Maximum Damage              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Strength + Base Value | (Strength + Base Value) x 2 | (Strength + Base Value) x 5 |
For example, a character with a Strength score of 3 is wielding a knife with a Base Value of 1. So, \[Minimum\] damage is 4, \[Normal Damage\] is 8, and \[Maximum Damage\] is 20. The \[Damage Array\] for this character is 4/8/20.
