You have it all, a multi-level penthouse, multiple vacation homes, a private island, a full-time staff of at least a dozen people, a private jet, helicopters, and cars. You eat only the best food. In a city of wall-to-wall concrete and steel, your properties are decorated with trees and plants, coy ponds and endangered animals. In Ridgeworld, you live at the peak, the pinnacle of the city, the very top of what was once known as the Appalachian Mountains.
