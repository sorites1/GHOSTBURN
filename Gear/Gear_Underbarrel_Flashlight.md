## Underbarrel Flashlight

An \[Underbarrel Flashlight\] is built into or attached to a firearm. When turned on, an \[Underbarrel Flashlight\] illuminates everything \[[[Keyword_Nearby|Nearby]]\] with a bright, white light, which eliminates the \[[[Condition_Dark|Dark]]\] condition from that area. Additionally, anyone in the illuminated area has difficulty seeing you, as the bright light obscures their vision. You have \[[[Condition_Concealment_Partial|Concealment, Partial]]\] against them.
