# Lifestyles Overview

In this game, your character has a monthly bill you have to pay called a Lifestyle. You can choose to pay for whichever lifestyle you want, and you can pay for up to three months in advance (if you are suddenly flush with cred, for example). However, if you the start of the month comes and you do not have the creds to pay for your current lifestyle, you will be forced to move down to a lifestyle that you are willing and able to pay for.
