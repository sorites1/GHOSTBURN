## Night Vision

\[Night Vision\] is a quality that can be applied to goggles, helmets (with visor), video cameras, and cybernetic eyes. When \[Night Vision\] is active, you can see as well in the darkness as you can in the light. You ignore the effects of \[Dark\].

When you are exposed to a bright light while using \[Night Vision], you are immediately \[[[Condition_Blinded|Blinded]]\]. If you disable \[Night Vision\], you lose \[Blinded\] at the end of your turn.
