## Difficulty Level

Each Difficulty Level (DL) has a name and a number in parenthesis. When you make a roll, you compare the result to the Difficulty Level to determine success or failure.

For example, Easy (6) means the action is easy to do and requires you to roll against a 6. If the result of your roll is a 6 or higher, your character succeeds.

There are six Difficulty Levels in this game: Automatic (2), Easy (6), Moderate (10), Hard (14), Severe (18), and Extreme (22).
