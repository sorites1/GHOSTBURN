## Setting the Difficulty Level

Each trick includes an entry for Difficulty Level (DL), which determines how difficult it is to execute. The DL for a trick is usually a **static DL** or based on an opponent's **traits**. Occasionally, a trick eschews the typical DL by calling for an \[Opposed\] roll.

### Difficulty Levels

Each Difficulty Level (DL) has a name and a number in parenthesis. When you make a roll, you compare the result to the Difficulty Level and Difficulty Range to determine the outcome.

For example, Easy (6) means the action is easy to do and requires you to roll against a 6. If the result of your roll is a 6 or higher, your character accomplished the task they set out to do.

A Difficulty Level has a range associated with it, as shown below. For example, the range for Easy (6) goes from 6 to 9. The next Difficulty Level picks up where the last one stopped, so Moderate (10) goes from 10 to 13, and so on. Rolling above or below the target range changes the outcome of your roll, as described under **Outcomes** below.

There are six Difficulty Levels in this game: Automatic (2), Easy (6), Moderate (10), Hard (14), Severe (18), and Extreme (22).

| Attempting something... | Difficulty Level | Difficulty Range |
| :---------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| Trivial                 | Automatic (2)    | 2 - 5            |
| Minor                   | Easy (6)         | 6 - 9            |
| Standard                | Moderate (10)    | 10 - 13          |
| Major                   | Hard (14)        | 14 - 17          |
| Massive                 | Severe (18)      | 18 - 21          |
| Monumental              | Extreme (22)     | 22 - 25          |

### Opposition Traits

Some tricks use one of an opponent's **trait** as the base Difficulty Level. For example, The Persuade (Convince) trick uses your opponent's Wits, and the Intimidate (Frighten) trick uses your opponent's Fort. 

Other forms of opposition can also have traits. For example, a computer system has a \[Security\] trait which determines how difficult it is to bypass through hacking.

Traits are expressed as Difficulty Levels. For example, Rico the food cart vendor has a Wits of Moderate (10), and the local Food Mart's payment system has a \[Security\] of Hard (14).

### Static DL

Some skill actions have a static Difficulty Level (DL). Instead of referring to an NPC trait or a DL Chart, it simply states the DL. For example, Insight (Size Up Opponent) has a DL of Moderate (10).

### Opposed Rolls

Occasionally, the rules call for an \[Opposed\] roll, which means both you and the GM roll and the outcome is determined by comparing results. As such, \[Opposed\] rolls do not use Difficulty Levels.

### GM Determines the DL

When these rules do not cover the action a player wants their character to perform, the GM can declare it an **improvised trick**. In such a case, it is the GM's job to set the Difficulty Level of the task using their best judgement and the chart above. Even DLs set by the GM should follow the standard of Easy (6) through Extreme (22).
