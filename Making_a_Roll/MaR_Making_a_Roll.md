## Making a Roll

When the GM determines that a roll is necessary, follow the steps below. 

1. **Skill** - First, identify the skill to use based on what the character is trying to do. For example, use the Firearms skill to shoot a gun and the Athletics skill to make a running jump. If you have a bonus in the selected skill, it is added to your roll.
   
2. **Ability Score** - The skill determines the [[Char_Abilities_and_Ability_Scores|ability score]] to use for the roll. For example, the Firearms skill uses Agility. You will add this ability score to your roll. 
   
3. **Trick** - Determine which of the skill's tricks to use. You can use any of the skill's [[Keyword_Core_Trick|core tricks]] or a [[Keyword_Signature_Trick|signature trick]] if you know one that applies.
   
4. **Difficulty Level** - The trick specifies the [[MaR_Difficulty_Level|Difficulty Level]] for the roll. The GM adjusts the Difficulty Level up or down, as described in [[MaR_Adjusting_the_Difficulty_Level|Adjusting the Difficulty Level]]. 
   
5. **Luck Bonus** - Before you roll the dice, you can spend a [[MaR_Luck_Points|Luck Point]] to get a [[Keyword_Luck_Bonus|luck bonus]] to your roll.
   
6. **Roll 2d10** - Roll 2d10 (two ten-sided dice) and sum them together. For example, if you rolled a 2 on one die and a 9 on the other die, you would have rolled 11.

7. **Ability Score and Skill Bonus** - Add your ability score to the roll. If you have a [[Keyword_Skill_Bonus|skill bonus]] in the skill you're using, add that to the roll too. For example, if you were rolling Firearms with an Agility score of 3 and a +1 skill bonus, you would add +4 to your roll.

8. **Gear and Aug Bonuses** - If you have a [[Keyword_Gear_Bonus|gear bonus]] from a piece of equipment or an [[Keyword_Aug_Bonus|aug bonus]] from a cybernetic augmentation or psionic mutation, add those as well. For example, using a laser sight grants a +1 gear bonus to Firearms rolls.  
   
9. **Outcome** - Compare the result to the outcomes chart in the description of the trick you used to determine what happens.

### Stacking Bonuses

For any roll, you add at most one **ability score**, one **skill bonus**, one **gear bonus**, one **aug bonus**, and one **luck bonus**. You always add one ability score, but you might not have all (or any) of these bonuses.

Bonuses of the same type that target the same skill do not stack, and only the highest one applies. For example, if you have two pieces of gear that both give a gear bonus to Firearms, only the higher of the two bonuses is applied. 

### Substituting Ability Scores

Even though each skill has its own primary ability, the GM might decide to call for another ability to be used with a skill if it's appropriate. 

For example, asking the player to roll Strength with Intimidate when they try to literally strongarm someone into compliance, or having the player roll Drive with Intelligence to see if they know the kind of battery used in a specific model car.
