## Outcomes

When you roll for a skill or trick, there are four possible outcomes: Glitch, Fade, Success, and Cool Success. 

### Universal Outcomes

Each trick's specific outcomes chart is modeled after the universal outcomes chart shown below. It shows how to determine if a result is a Glitch, Fade, Success, or Cool Success. The GM should also use this chart to adjudicate improvised tricks when they arise. 

For the purpose of determining outcomes, treat the range from 2 - 7 as a Trivial DL and 39+ as an Impossible DL. This framework allows for a Fade on an Easy (8) DL, a Glitch on a Moderate (14) DL, and a Cool Success on an Extreme (32) DL.

Rolling double 10s on 2d10 automatically results in a Cool Success.

| Outcome      | Roll                                           | Description                                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Glitch       | Falls in the DL range two or more levels lower | The task failed with a complication                           |
| Fade         | Falls in the DL range one level lower          | The task was completed successfully but with a complication   |
| Success      | Hits the DL range                              | The task was completed successfully                           |
| Cool Success | Over the DL range                              | The task was completed successfully and with an extra benefit |

### Trick Outcomes

When you use a trick included in these rules, you should use the specific outcomes chart included in its description. Each trick has its own outcomes chart but the structure of the four outcomes always follows the universal outcomes shown above. As an example, the outcomes chart for the **Persuade (Haggle)** signature trick is shown below.

| Outcome      | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Glitch       | You get 20% worse price and their \[Attitude\] worsens  |
| Fade         | You get 20% better price and their \[Attitude\] worsens |
| Success      | You get 20% better price                                |
| Cool Success | You get 20% better price and a \[Gift\]                 |

For example, a player rolls Persuade (Haggle) with a DL of Moderate (14). After applying bonuses, their roll results in a 15. This is a Success because the result falls inside the DL range for Moderate (14), which is 14-19.
### Opposed Outcomes

When the rules call for an \[Opposed\] roll (or when the GM decides an \[Opposed\] roll is appropriate), you and the GM both roll, add your bonuses, and compare results. Tricks that use \[Opposed\] rolls have their own specific outcomes. When the GM declares an action to be an improvised trick, they should refer to the chart below to determine the outcome of the contest.

| Outcome      | Roll                          | Description                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Glitch       | Lower than the GM's roll      | The task failed with a complication                           |
| Fade         | Equals the GM's roll          | The task was completed successfully but with a complication   |
| Success      | 1-5 higher than the GM's roll | The task was completed successfully                           |
| Cool Success | 6+ higher than the GM's roll  | The task was completed successfully and with an extra benefit |
For example, a player wants their character to use Brawl (Grapple) on an opponent. This is an \[Opposed\] roll, so both the GM and the player roll. After applying their bonuses, the GM's result is 9 and the player's result is 12. This is a Success because 12 is 1-5 higher than the GM's result which was 9.
