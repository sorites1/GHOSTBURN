# Luck Points

Luck Points can give you bonuses to your rolls and help you avoid terrible failures, as described below. You start the game with one Luck Point. 

### Buy Luck Points

In addition to the Luck Point you get at the start of the game, you can purchase up to two additional Luck Points for 10 XP each. You cannot have more than three Luck Points at any time. Luck Points you purchase are permanent additions to your character. They are spent and recovered as normal.

### Spending a Luck Point

You can spend a Luck Point in a few ways, as shown below. Once you spend a Luck Point, it is gone for the rest of the game session unless you recover it.

To use a Luck Point you must declare it to the GM and the rest of the group. You must also state how you want to use the Luck Point. 

For example, *"I'm going to spend a Luck Point to get a bonus on my Firearms roll. I'm using Single Shot. Firearms is one of my Favored Skills, so I get a +3 Luck Bonus."*

#### Luck Bonus

Before you [[Making_a_Roll/MaR_Making_a_Roll|make a roll]], you can spend a Luck Point to get a +2 Luck Bonus to your roll result. If the roll uses one of your Favored Skills, you get a +3 Luck Bonus instead.

#### Avoid a Glitch

If you roll a Glitch, you can spend a Luck Point to \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Upgraded|Upgrade]]\] the outcome to a Fade.

#### Recovering Luck Points

At the start of each game session, your character recovers all of the Luck Points they previously spent. Some tricks and other effects can make you \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Lucky|Lucky]]\], which causes you to recover a Luck Point mid-session.
