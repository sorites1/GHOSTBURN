= Round Robin: The Flow of the Game

This game uses a round robin turn-taking style for all scenes and actions, including those in combat and out of combat. In fact, in terms of player facetime with the GM, _this game makes no distinction between combat and non-combat turns_.

It is possible for some players to be in combat while other players are not. This does not alter the turn order. The game will always proceed in a round robin manner, even if that means you end up with a mix, such as, one player takes a turn in combat, the next player takes a turn _outside of combat_, and the last player takes a turn _in a different combat_.

This game is designed to allow players to have their characters act independently from one another without forcing anyone to "sit out" until one group's actions have been resolved. Instead, this game blends everyone's actions together in an orderly way by requiring everyone to take turns.

== Turn Order

Each time your group assembles, whether online or in person, to play the game, the GM will start by setting the stage, reminding everyone of the events of last session, and so on.

Play begins with the player to the GM's left. They describe what their character does, and the GM responds accordingly. Then, play proceeds to the left and the next player takes a turn, and so on, until everyone has taken a turn, and play comes back to the GM.

It is not necessary to maintain the same turn order from session to session, and players are free to choose different seats at the start of each session. On the other hand, some groups may prefer a consistent order and will choose to keep their same seats every session.
== Your Turn

On your turn, you tell the GM what you want your character to do. You can also ask questions of the GM or other players, whether their characters are with you or not. While in-game actions and dice rolls are shared openly, players are expected to keep their characters' knowledge separate. Just because you heard it, doesn't mean your character did.
== Types of Turns

There are four types of turns in this game: _regular turns_, _combat turns_, _group turns_, and _GM turns_.
=== Regular Turn

A regular turn typically involves narration and may include the use of a few skill actions. You might describe your character doing something dangerous like sneaking into an abandoned warehouse.

During your turn, the GM may call for up to three rolls, such as a Climb / Jump roll to hop the fence, a Move Silently roll to avoid notice, and a Street Hack roll to open the lock.

However, this is not a hard rule, and the GM is not required to call for three (or any) rolls. Regular turns are less structured than combat turns and rely on both the GM and the player to regulate the amount of time spent.
=== Combat Turn

A combat turn is strictly regimented by the use of 3 Action Points (AP). At the start of your turn, you gain 3 AP if you are in combat. You may spend your AP as you wish throughout your turn. Once all of your AP is spent, or you do not wish to spend them all, your turn is over.
=== Group Turns

When the group is partially or completely together in the same place at the same time, the GM is free to drop individual turns in favor of group turns. Group turns offer a loose, collaborative segment in which players share their ideas and narrate their character's actions without a formal turn order. This is a great time to let the players show off their characters' personalities and quirks, and it lets them roleplay with one another.

Group turns are especially useful when time is compressed or actions are routine, such as when traveling across the city, which could take a couple of hours or more. If players prefer to stay in the round robin turn order during group scenes, that is perfectly fine. Some players may want the opportunity to narrate what their character is doing during this moment of downtime.

Anyone not part of these group turns should still be given their individual turns, whether regular or combat.
Players should generally avoid interrupting other players on their turns. However, if one player narrates an action that would directly impact another player, the GM may allow the second player to react directly before returning to the first player. Any reaction by a second player should be minimal to preserve the first player's turn.

If you are unsure of what to do on your turn, the GM may also prompt you with a question or two to help you identify possible actions your character could take. However, you are not required to take an action on your turn. You may pass.
=== GM Turn

When play comes back to the GM, it signals a potential escalation. The GM can use their turn to introduce new characters into a scene, whether in combat or not. The GM should also use their turn to run the opposition against those who are in combat.

= When to Roll

When a player describes what their character is doing, the GM first determines if a roll is necessary. If the task is trivial, impossible, or carries no risk, such that a character could keep trying until they were successful, then it is not necessary to roll.

#table(
  inset: 4pt,
  stroke: 1pt,
  fill: none,
  columns: (auto, auto, auto),
  rows: (auto),
  [Task], [Resolution], [Examples],
    [Trivial], [You succeed], [Open a door
Make a phone call
Log on to the Net],
    [Impossible], [You cannot attempt], [Jump over a house
Run across water
Access cyberspace without jacking in],
    [No Risk], [Keep trying until you succeed], [Climb over a small fence
Navigate to an unfamiliar destination
Repair a piece of broken equipment]
)

== Making a Roll

When the GM determines that a roll is necessary, they identify the skill and ability score for the player to use, as well as the Difficulty Level of the task. Difficulty Levels range from Automatic (2) to Extreme (22).

The player rolls a d20 and adds the appropriate ability score to get the result.

If the result equals or exceeds the Difficulty Level, the character succeeds (and may have critically succeeded). If the result is less than the target number, the character fails (and may have critically failed).
It's important to realize that the same task can be performed automatically when there is no risk but requires a roll when there is. For example, climbing over a small fence is relatively easy to do but still requires some effort. All else being equal, a character could keep trying until they succeed; no need to roll. However, that same task requires a roll if we introduce risk. For example, a character is being chased and rounds the corner to see a small fence blocking their path. Now, if the character decides to go over the fence, the GM should have the player roll, even if the task is easy, because failure leads to consequences (the pursuers catch up).
== Abilities

Each character is composed of the following abilities:

- _Strength --_ A measure of a character's physical form and raw strength

- _Agility_ -- Reflects a character's quickness, reaction speed, and manual dexterity

- _Intellect_ -- Indicates a character's education and critical thinking

- _Perception_ -- Represents a character's senses and is the source of psionic ability

- _Presence_ -- A combination of raw magnetism, artistic talent, and social insight

- _Resilience_ -- Mental and physical fortitude; resist injury and psychic burn


=== Ability Scores

Each character has a number, called an ability score, associated with each of their abilities as shown below.

#table(
  inset: 4pt,
  stroke: 1pt,
  fill: none,
  columns: (auto, auto, auto),
  rows: (auto),
  [Ability Score], [Ability Level], [Description],
    [0], [Incapable], [Completely incapable, non-functional],
    [1], [Feeble], [Barely capable, like a small child],
    [2], [Average], [Human average, sufficient for most things in life],
    [3], [Impressive], [A step up from most people, competent and capable],
    [4], [Exceptional], [Better than most, a serious contender],
    [5], [Amazing], [Near the top, a thrill to behold],
    [6], [Peak Human], [The best of the best humankind has to offer],
    [7], [Superhuman], [Beyond human limits, breathtaking],
    [8], [Extraordinary], [Nearing limits of the animal kingdom, apex predator],
    [9], [Peak Animal], [The best of the best the animal kingdom has to offer],
    [10], [Construct], [Beyond the limits of the animal kingdom; artificial],
    [11], [Transcendent], [Passing beyond humans' ability to construct],
    [12], [Legendary], [Stories are told of such things, awe-inspiring],
    [13], [Unfathomable], [Almost beyond comprehension, unimaginable],
    [14], [Supreme], [Nearly breaking the laws of nature, mind-bending],
    [15], [Absolute], [Theoretical maximum, godlike capability]
)

== Difficulty Level

Each Difficulty Level (DL) includes a name and a number in parenthesis. When you use a skill action, you roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability score. Then you compare the result to the DL to determine success or failure.

For example, Easy (6) means the action is easy to do and requires you to roll against a 6. If the result is a 6 or higher, your character succeeds.

There are six Difficulty Levels in this game: Automatic (2), Easy (6), Moderate (10), Hard (14), Severe (18), and Extreme (22).

#table(
  inset: 4pt,
  stroke: 1pt,
  fill: none,
  columns: (auto, auto),
  rows: (auto),
  [Attempting something...], [Difficulty Level],
    [Trivial], [Automatic (2)],
    [Minor], [Easy (6)],
    [Standard], [Moderate (10)],
    [Major], [Hard (14)],
    [Massive], [Severe (18)],
    [Monumental], [Extreme (22)]
)
Before you roll, adjust the DL by applying relevant conditions, qualities, and enhancements.

== Setting the Base Difficulty Level

Each skill action includes an entry for Difficulty Level (DL), which determines how easy or difficult it is to execute.

The DL used by a skill action can be based on one of the target's _traits_, the skill action's _DL chart_, or a _static DL_..
=== Traits

Some skill actions use an opponent's trait as the base Difficulty Level. For example, Persuade uses the target's Wits, and Ghost Trace uses the target system's Security trait.

_Traits_ are only found in stat blocks for the opposition, never in player-characters, and they are expressed as Difficulty Levels. For example, Rico the food cart vendor has a Wits of Moderate (10), and the local Food Mart's payment system has a Security of Hard (14).
==== Skill Action Difficulty Level Chart

Sometimes, the GM is responsible for setting the base DL. As the GM, use your common sense, along with the guidance provided in the Difficulty Level chart included in the skill action's description.
=== Static DL

Some skill actions have a static Difficulty Level (DL). Instead of referring to an NPC trait or a DL Chart, it simply states the DL. For example, Size Up Opponent has a DL of Moderate (10).
== Adjusting the Difficulty Level

Before making a roll, adjust the base Difficulty Level of the task by taking relevant qualities, conditions, and enhancements into account.


=== Qualities

Qualities are short, freeform descriptors that are not specifically defined by the game's rules. A quality is an aspect of a person, place, or thing. When the GM calls for a roll each quality relevant to the situation raises or lowers the Difficulty Level.

For example, Rico the food cart vendor has the quality, \[Needs the Money\]. Qualities like this can help inform the GM's roleplaying and decision making.

A quality like \[Needs the Money\] means the character probably prioritizes their income and savings over other aspects of their life. They are likely to be thrifty or even penny-pinching.

Places and things can have qualities too. A night club might have the qualities, \[Loud\], \[Dark\], and \[Packed\], or a wooden door could have the quality, \[Solid Oak\], which speaks to its sturdiness and difficulty to break down.

The same quality can raise one Difficulty Level while lowering another. For example, the quality \[Dark\] makes it harder to scan the room and find your friends, so it would raise the DL by one. On the other hand, if you are trying to hide, the \[Dark\] is a benefit, so it would lower the DL by one.

Qualities are added and removed as appropriate. For example, during the day, when the maintenance crew is working, the night club no longer has the qualities \[Dark\], \[Loud\], or \[Packed\] because the lights are on, there's no music, and only a handful of workers are present.
=== Conditions

Conditions are temporary effects on people codified by these rules. \[Off Guard\], \[Distracted\], and \[Hidden\] are examples of conditions that could affect your character.

The entry for each condition includes its name, its causes, how it affects your character, and how to remove it. As with qualities, conditions can raise or lower Difficulty Levels, but they usually have other effects as well.
== Attitude

Using a \[Social\] skill action on someone with a Hostile Attitude toward you raises the Difficulty Level by one.

Using a \[Social\] skill action on someone with a Friendly Attitude toward you lowers the Difficulty Level by one.
== Enhancements

Weapons and gear often include (or can be modified to support) specific features that raise or lower the DL under specific circumstances.

For example, a weapon with recoil compensation lowers the DL of all attacks made with it. Goggles or cyber eyes with low light vision balance the Difficulty Level of skill actions that would otherwise be made more difficult in low light. These effects, whether from a weapon, piece of gear, or cybernetic modification, are collectively known as enhancements.
=== Adjusting Difficulty Level: Step-by-Step

Adjusting the Difficulty Level  of a roll is a joint activity carried out by the GM and the player, together.

#table(
  inset: 4pt,
  stroke: 1pt,
  fill: none,
  columns: (auto, auto, auto),
  rows: (auto),
  [Step], [Description], [Example],
    [1], [The player states what their character wants to do.], [Player: _My character is trying to convince Rico the street vendor to give her a hot Cup-O-Kaffe._],
    [2], [The GM identifies the skill action to use, as well as the base Difficulty Level for the roll.], [GM: _OK, that's Persuade, and you'll roll that with Presence. Persuade uses the target's Wits as the Difficulty Level, and Rico's Wits is Moderate (10), so that's the base DL for your roll._],
    [3], [The GM announces each modifier that raises the DL. See the Exceeding Extreme (22) sidebar.], [GM: _Rico’s Attitude is currently \\\[Neutral\\\] towards you, so that doesn’t change anything, but he also has three qualities: \\\[Loves Dogs\\\], which doesn’t apply here, and \\\[Needs the Money\\\], which does. He’s also got \\\[Grumpy\\\] and that applies too. That raises the Difficulty Level two times (once for \\\[Needs the Money\\\] and once for \\\[Grumpy\\\]). So, the Difficulty Level goes from Moderate (10) to Severe (18)._],
    [4], [The player announces each modifier they have that lowers the Difficulty Level.], [Player: _My character has a pheromone implant, which lowers  the DL on Persuade rolls. So, that drops it back down from Severe (18) to Hard (14)._],
    [5], [The player rolls and adds their character’s ability score.], [Player: _So, I roll a d20 and add my Presence score, which is 4. I rolled an 11. Adding 4, I have a result of 15._],
    [6], [Resolve the roll by comparing the result to the Difficulty Level.], [Player: _I got a 15. The DL was Hard (14), so I succeeded! I get a free Cup-O-Kaffe!_],
    [7], [The GM affirms the resolution.], [GM: _Rico looks at you and says, “You know, I don’t usually do this, but here." He hands you the Cup-O-Kaffe. "You look like you need it..”_]
)

== Exceeding Extreme (22)

As you adjust the Difficulty Level (DL) by layering on more and more modifiers, you may find yourself going past Extreme (22). When this happens, keep going and refer to extra levels as Extreme (+1), Extreme (+2), and so on.

For example, consider a character who is making an attack against a target.

- For this attack, the skill action dictates the base DL is Moderate (10).
- The GM says the target is at long range.
- Each range increment beyond short raises the DL by one.
- Going from short to medium range raises the DL to Hard (14).
- Going from medium to long range raises the DL to Severe (18).
- The GM adds \[Dark\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (22).
- The GM adds \[Rain\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (+1).

After the GM finishes raising the DL, proceed with lowering the DL according to modifiers identified by the player. If the player is unable to reduce the DL to Extreme (22) or lower, then what they are trying to do is not possible. You cannot ch01_11.1_Making_a_Roll|make a roll if the DL is Extreme (+1) or higher.
#table(
  inset: 4pt,
  stroke: 1pt,
  fill: none,
  columns: (auto, auto, auto, auto),
  rows: (auto),
  [Outcome], [Description], [Effect], [Example],
    [_Success_], [The result equals or exceeds the DL.], [You achieve your goal.], [_You hit the target; roll damage._],
    [_Critical Success_], [You roll a natural 20, or the result is at least 10 higher than the DL.], [You achieve your goal and gain an extra benefit.], [_You hit the target; roll double damage or pick a body part to apply a condition._],
    [_Failure_], [The result is lower than the DL.], [Your attempt fails. You do not achieve your goal.], [_You miss the target and deal no damage._],
    [_Critical Failure_], [You roll a natural 1, or the result at least 10 lower than the DL.], [Your attempt fails. You do not achieve your goal, and you suffer a complication.], [_You miss the target and deal no damage. Also, your weapon runs out of ammo and needs a reload (1 AP)._]
)

When an outcome is downgraded, it means the effectiveness of the task or skill action was reduced.

- A critical success is treated as a success.
- A success is treated as a failure.
- A failure is treated as a critical failure.
When an outcome is upgraded, it means the effectiveness of the task or skill action was heightened.

- A success is treated as a critical success.
- A failure is treated as a success.
- A critical failure is treated as a failure.
== Outcomes

When you use a skill action, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability score to get the result. Compare the result to the Difficulty Level (DL) to determine the outcome: _success_, _critical success_, _failure_, or _critical failure_.
=== Success

If the result is equal to or greater than the DL, the character _succeeded_.
=== Critical Success

If you rolled a 20 on the die (without adding your ability score), it's called a _Natural 20_, and it counts as a _critical success_. Another way to get a critical success is if your result (including your ability score) is higher than the DL by 10 or more.
=== Failure

If the result is less than the DL, the character _failed_.
=== Critical Failure

If you rolled a 1 on the die (without adding your ability score), it's called a _Natural 1_, and it counts as a _critical failure_. You can also get a critical failure if your result (including your ability score) is less than the DL by 10 or more.
=== Stress and Choice

Some skill actions prescribe two other kinds of outcomes: stress and choice. _Stress_ means you suffer a complication related to whatever you were doing that could alter things if not handled with care. _Choice_ means you or the GM are given a choice about what comes next.
#table(

  [Outcome], [Description], [Effect], [Example],

Complication: The system security timer starts. Due to the security rating, you have 6 rounds before you get caught and trigger an an IC encounter._],
    [_Choice_], [The outcome of a skill action you used has an entry _labeled_, Choice.], [Apply the outcome. If the Choice is for you, the GM will offer it to you, as described in the Choice entry. If the Choice is for the GM, they will tell you which one they chose and how it plays out.], [_You fail to gain system access with Penetrate Firewall. Choice: Do you want to try again? If you fail on your second attempt, you will trigger an IC encounter. Or you can back off and wait an hour for the system to cool down before trying again._]
)
