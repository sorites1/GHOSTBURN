## Outcomes

To determine the outcome of a skill action roll, compare the result of your roll to the Difficulty Level (DL). The better the roll, the better the outcome.

| Failure          | Your Result                | Description                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical Failure | You rolled a 1 on your d20 | As Standard Failure and you suffer a \[Complication\] |
| Standard Failure | Lower then the DL          | The action fails and you suffer a \[Setback\]         |

| Success       | Your Result          | Description                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Minor (6)     | Equals or exceeds 6  | The action succeeds but \[With a Cost\]                            |
| Moderate (10) | Equals or exceeds 10 | The action succeeds                                                |
| Major (14)    | Equals or exceeds 14 | The action succeeds \[With One Benefit\]                           |
| Severe (18)   | Equals or exceeds 18 | The action succeeds \[With Two Benefits]                           |
