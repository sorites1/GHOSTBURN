## Outcomes

To determine the outcome of a skill action roll, compare the result of your roll to the Difficulty Level (DL). The better the roll, the better the outcome.


| Outcome      | Roll Result                  | Description                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Glitch       | 2+ levels under the DL range | You fail to accomplish the task and suffer a complication |
| Fade         | 1 level under the DL range   | You accomplished but suffer a complication                |
| Success      | Hit the DL range             | You accomplished the task as intended                     |
| Cool Success | Over the DL range            | You accomplished the task and get an added benefit        |
