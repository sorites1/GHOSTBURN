## Adjusting the Difficulty Level

Before making a roll, adjust the base Difficulty Level of the task by taking relevant attitude, conditions, and qualities into account. The GM and the player work together to first identify things that raise the DL. Then they identify things that lower the DL back down. Once the final DL has been determined, the player makes their roll.

### Attitude

Using a \[Social\] skill on someone with a **Hostile** Attitude toward you **raises** the Difficulty Level by one. 

Using a \[Social\] skill on someone with a **Friendly** Attitude toward you **lowers** the Difficulty Level by one. 

Some tricks cause a target's \[Attitude\] to go up or down. If the target's \[Attitude\] is Friendly, it cannot go up. If the target's \[Attitude\] is Hostile and something causes it to go down, the target gains the \[Break\] condition.

## Conditions

Conditions are (often temporary) effects that raise or lower the DL, such as \[Wounded\], \[Distracted\], and \[Windy\]. 

Conditions are described in their own section later in this book. The entry for each condition includes its name, its causes, how it affects your character, and how to remove it. As with qualities, conditions can raise or lower Difficulty Levels, but they usually have other effects as well.

### NPC Qualities

NPC qualities are aspects of the NPC's personality and they are often determined by the GM on-the-fly as the players encounter new and different people in the game world. These qualities are nothing more than simple descriptors that help the GM roleplay the NPC and better understand their point of view. However, NPCs qualities raise or lower the DL if they are relevant to the outcome of a task. An NPC generally has between one and three qualities. 

For example, Rico the Food Cart Vendor has the qualities \[Loves Dogs\], and \[Grumpy\].

### Weapon and Equipment Modifiers

Some weapons and equipment include modifiers that raise or lower the DL when they are relevant to the outcome of a task. For example, night vision goggles lower the DL by one when a target is in the \[Dark\], thus counteracting the condition's effect, which raises the DL by one. In some cases, you need to spend an action point (1 AP) to use a weapon or gear modifier. For example, to use the folding stock that comes with some weapons, you must spend 1 AP to deploy it. 

Weapon and gear modifiers are described in the **Equipment** section later in this book.

## Adjusting Difficulty Level: Step-by-Step

Adjusting the Difficulty Level  of a roll is a joint activity carried out by the GM and the player, together.

| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The player states what their character wants to do.                                           | Player: *My character is trying to convince Rico the street vendor to give her a hot Cup-O-Kaffe.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2    | The GM identifies the skill action to use, as well as the base Difficulty Level for the roll. | GM: *OK, that's Persuade, and you'll roll that with Presence. Persuade uses the target's Wits as the Difficulty Level, and Rico's Wits is Moderate (10), so that's the base DL for your roll.*                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3    | The GM announces each modifier that raises the DL. See the Exceeding Extreme (22) sidebar.    | GM: *Rico’s Attitude is currently \[Neutral\] towards you, so that doesn’t change anything, but he also has two qualities: \[Loves Dogs\], which doesn’t apply here, and \[Grumpy\], which does. That raises the Difficulty Level to Hard (14). Also, because it is unreasonable to think a street vendor would give away their product for free, the GM raises the DL again to Severe (18).* |
| 4    | The player announces each modifier they have that lowers the Difficulty Level.                | Player: *My character has a pheromone implant, which lowers  the DL on Persuade rolls. So, that drops it back down from Severe (18) to Hard (14).*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5    | The player rolls and adds their character’s ability score.                                    | Player: *So, I roll 2d10 and add my Presence score, which is 4. I rolled an 11. Adding 4, I have a result of 15.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 6    | Resolve the roll by comparing the result to the Difficulty Level.                             | Player: *I got a 15. The DL was Hard (14), so I got a Success! I get a free Cup-O-Kaffe!*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 7    | The GM affirms the resolution.                                                                | GM: *Rico looks at you and says, “You know, I don’t usually do this, but here." He hands you the Cup-O-Kaffe. "You look like you need it..”*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
## Exceeding Extreme (22)

As you adjust the Difficulty Level (DL) by layering on more and more modifiers, you may find yourself going past Extreme (22). When this happens, keep going and refer to extra levels as Extreme (+1), Extreme (+2), and so on.

For example, consider a character who is using Firearms (Crippling Shot) against a target who is \[Far Away\] in the \[Dark\] while it is \[Raining\].

- For this attack, the Crippling Shot trick dictates the DL is Hard (14).
- The target is \[Far\] away and the firearm your character is using has an optimal range of \[Nearby\] so that raises the DL by one to Severe (18).
- The area is \[Dark\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (22).
- It is also \[Raining\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (+1).

After the GM finishes raising the DL, proceed with lowering the DL according to modifiers identified by the player. If the player is unable to reduce the DL to Extreme (22) or lower, then what they are trying to do is not possible. You cannot make a roll if the DL is Extreme (+1) or higher.
