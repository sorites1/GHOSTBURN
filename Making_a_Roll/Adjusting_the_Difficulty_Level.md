## Adjusting the Difficulty Level

Before making a roll, adjust the base Difficulty Level of the task by taking relevant attitude, conditions, and qualities into account. The GM and the player work together to first identify things that raise the DL. Then they identify things that lower the DL back down. Once the final DL has been determined, the player makes their roll.

### Attitude

Using a \[Social\] skill action on someone with a **Hostile** Attitude toward you **raises** the Difficulty Level by one. 

Using a \[Social\] skill action on someone with a **Friendly** Attitude toward you **lowers** the Difficulty Level by one. 

Some skill actions cause a target's \[Attitude\] to go up or down. If the target's \[Attitude\] is Friendly, it cannot go up. If the target's \[Attitude\] is Hostile and something causes it to go down, the target gains the \[Break\] condition.

## Conditions

Conditions are effects on people codified by these rules. \[Off Guard\], \[Distracted\], and \[Hidden\] are examples of conditions that could affect your character or the target of your skill action. 

Conditions are described in their own section later in this book. The entry for each condition includes its name, its causes, how it affects your character, and how to remove it. As with qualities, conditions can raise or lower Difficulty Levels, but they usually have other effects as well.

## Qualities

Whereas conditions apply to people, qualities are apply to places and things. Qualities directly raise or lower the Difficulty Level of a roll or reference conditions that raise or lower the DL. 

### Environmental Qualities

| Quality  | Type          | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dark     | Environmental | Total (or near-total) darkness makes it very difficult to see. Targets in the \[Dark\] have \[Total Concealment\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Fog      | Environmental | Thick fog makes it difficulty to see. Targets in \[Fog\] have \[Partial Concealment\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Icy      | Environmental | Icy surfaces make it difficult to walk and run across the affected area. An \[Icy\] area is considered \[Slippery\].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Rain     | Environmental | A steady rainfall makes it difficult to see and hear. Targets in the \[Rain\] have \[Partial Concealment\] to you. Listen rolls made to hear in the \[Rain\] have their DL raised by one.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Slippery | Environmental | The object or surface is very slick and hard to grip. To grab and hold an object that is \[Slippery\], you must succeed on a basic Agility roll with a DL of Hard (14). Failure means you drop the object. To move across a surface that is \[Slippery\], you must succeed on a basic Agility roll with a DL of Hard (14). Failure means you fall prone. |
| Windy    | Environmental | Strong wind makes it difficulty to hit a distant target. When it is \[Windy\] and you make a \[Ranged\] attack roll at a target that is at long range, the DL is raised by one.                                                                                                                                                                          |
### Weapon and Equipment Qualities

| Quality       | Type                 | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Night Vision  | Equipment, Cyberware | You can see as well in the darkness as you can in the light. You ignore the effects of \[Dark\].                                                                                                                |
| Folding Stock | Weapon               | This weapon includes a folding stock, which can be deployed in combat by spending 1 AP. When deployed, the folding stock reduces recoil, causing attacks made with this weapon to have their DL lowered by one. |
| Gas Vents     | Weapon               | This weapon includes gas vents that help reduce recoil. Attacks made with this weapon have their DL lowered by one.                                                                                             |
| Scope         | Weapon               | This weapon includes a scope that helps you hit distant targets. Attacks made with this weapon against targets at medium or long range have their DL lowered by one.                                            |
| Silencer      | Weapon               | This weapon includes a silencer that reduces the muzzle flash and noise caused by firing. Attempts to notice the sound of gunfire or the muzzle flash when this weapon is fired have their DL raised by one.    |
## Adjusting Difficulty Level: Step-by-Step

Adjusting the Difficulty Level  of a roll is a joint activity carried out by the GM and the player, together.

| Step | Description                                                                                   | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The player states what their character wants to do.                                           | Player: *My character is trying to convince Rico the street vendor to give her a hot Cup-O-Kaffe.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2    | The GM identifies the skill action to use, as well as the base Difficulty Level for the roll. | GM: *OK, that's Persuade, and you'll roll that with Presence. Persuade uses the target's Wits as the Difficulty Level, and Rico's Wits is Moderate (10), so that's the base DL for your roll.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3    | The GM announces each modifier that raises the DL. See the Exceeding Extreme (22) sidebar.    | GM: *Rico’s Attitude is currently \[Neutral\] towards you, so that doesn’t change anything, but he also has three qualities: \[Loves Dogs\], which doesn’t apply here, and \[Needs the Money\], which does. He’s also got \[Grumpy\] and that applies too. That raises the Difficulty Level two times (once for \[Needs the Money\] and once for \[Grumpy\]). So, the Difficulty Level goes from Moderate (10) to Severe (18).* |
| 4    | The player announces each modifier they have that lowers the Difficulty Level.                | Player: *My character has a pheromone implant, which lowers  the DL on Persuade rolls. So, that drops it back down from Severe (18) to Hard (14).*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5    | The player rolls and adds their character’s ability score.                                    | Player: *So, I roll a d20 and add my Presence score, which is 4. I rolled an 11. Adding 4, I have a result of 15.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 6    | Resolve the roll by comparing the result to the Difficulty Level.                             | Player: *I got a 15. The DL was Hard (14), so I succeeded! I get a free Cup-O-Kaffe!*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 7    | The GM affirms the resolution.                                                                | GM: *Rico looks at you and says, “You know, I don’t usually do this, but here." He hands you the Cup-O-Kaffe. "You look like you need it..”*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
## Exceeding Extreme (22)

As you adjust the Difficulty Level (DL) by layering on more and more modifiers, you may find yourself going past Extreme (22). When this happens, keep going and refer to extra levels as Extreme (+1), Extreme (+2), and so on.

For example, consider a character who is making an attack against a target.

- For this attack, the skill action dictates the base DL is Moderate (10).
- The GM says the target is at long range.
- Each range increment beyond short raises the DL by one.
- Going from short to medium range raises the DL to Hard (14).
- Going from medium to long range raises the DL to Severe (18).
- The GM adds \[Dark\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (22).
- The GM adds \[Rain\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (+1).

After the GM finishes raising the DL, proceed with lowering the DL according to modifiers identified by the player. If the player is unable to reduce the DL to Extreme (22) or lower, then what they are trying to do is not possible. You cannot make a roll if the DL is Extreme (+1) or higher.
