## Adjusting the Difficulty Level

Before the roll, the GM should adjust the DL based on relevant **conditions**, the NPC's **\[Attitude\]**, or **environmental effects**. 

### Conditions

Conditions like \[Wounded\], \[Distracted\], and \[Inspired\] raise or lower the DL on rolls you make. Conditions are described in their own section later in this book. If a character is under the effects of multiple conditions that alter the DL, they all apply.

### Attitude

When you use a \[Social\] trick on an NPC, their \[Attitude\] towards you can raise or lower the DL.

| Attitude | Effect                                         |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Hostile  | Raises the DL of your \[Social\] tricks by one |
| Neutral  | No effect                                      |
| Friendly | Lowers the DL of your \[Social\] tricks by one |

Some tricks cause a target's \[Attitude\] to go up or down. If the target's \[Attitude\] is Hostile and something causes it to go down, the target gains the \[Break\] condition.

### Environmental Effects

When the environment could influence the outcome of a roll, the GM can raise or lower the DL by one, as appropriate. No matter how many environmental effects are at work, they only adjust the DL up or down by one level. For example, if the area is windy, dark, and raining, those environmental effects only raise or lower the DL by one level. 

### Easy (8) and Extreme (32)

You cannot adjust the DL below Easy (8) or beyond Extreme (32). If something were to cause the DL to go lower than Easy (8), it stays at Easy (8). Likewise, if something were to push the DL above Extreme (32), it stays at Extreme (32).
