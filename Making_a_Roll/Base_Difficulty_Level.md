### Setting the Base Difficulty Level

Each skill action includes an entry for Difficulty Level (DL), which determines how easy or difficult it is to execute. 

The DL used by a skill action can be based on one of the target's **traits**, the skill action's **DL chart**, or a **static DL**.
#### NPC Traits

Some skill actions use an opponent's trait as the base Difficulty Level. For example, Persuade uses the target's Wits, and Ghost Trace uses the target system's Security trait.

**Traits** are only found in stat blocks for the opposition, never in player-characters, and they are expressed as Difficulty Levels. For example, Rico the food cart vendor has a Wits of Moderate (10), and the local Food Mart's payment system has a Security of Hard (14).

#### Difficulty Level Chart

Sometimes, the GM is responsible for setting the base DL. As the GM, use your common sense, along with the guidance provided in the Difficulty Level chart included in the skill action's description.

#### Static DL

Some skill actions have a static Difficulty Level (DL). Instead of referring to an NPC trait or a DL Chart, it simply states the DL. For example, Size Up Opponent has a DL of Moderate (10).
