### Setting the Base Difficulty Level

Each skill action includes an entry for Difficulty Level (DL), which determines how easy or difficult it is to execute. 

The DL used by a skill action can be based on one of the target's **traits**, the skill action's **DL chart**, or a **static DL**.
#### NPC Traits

Some skill actions use an opponent's trait as the base Difficulty Level. For example, Persuade uses the target's WITS, and Ghost Trace uses the target system's Security trait.

**Traits** are only found in stat blocks for the opposition, never in player-characters, and they are expressed as Difficulty Levels. For example, Rico the food cart vendor has a WITS of Moderate (10), and the local Food Mart's payment system has a \[Security\] of Hard (14).



#### Static DL

Some skill actions have a static Difficulty Level (DL). Instead of referring to an NPC trait or a DL Chart, it simply states the DL. For example, Size Up Opponent has a DL of Moderate (10).
