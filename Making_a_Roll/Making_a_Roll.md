## Making a Roll

When the GM determines that a roll is necessary, they identify the skill (or skill action) and ability score for the player to use, as well as the Difficulty Level of the task. 

### Roll a d20

The player rolls a **d20** (a twenty-sided die) and adds the **ability score** along with any **bonuses** to get the result.

| d20 + Ability Score + Skill Action Bonus + Luck Bonus = Result |
### Ability Score

All skills (and their skill actions) are associated with a primary ability score, as shown on your character sheet. For example, the Influence skill and its skill actions (Persuade, Intimidate, and Entertain) use Presence. 

The GM might decide to call for another ability score to be used if it's appropriate, such as asking the player to roll Strength with Influence (Intimidate) when they try to literally strongarm someone into compliance.  

### Bonuses

If you have a bonus to the skill action, add it to your roll. 

If the skill you're rolling is a favored skill, you can spend a luck point to get a +1 bonus added to your roll (in addition to your ability score and skill action bonus).

### Outcome

Compare the result to the DL to determine success or failure. 

If the result equals or exceeds the Difficulty Level, the character succeeds (and may have critically succeeded). If the result is less than the target number, the character fails (and may have critically failed).
