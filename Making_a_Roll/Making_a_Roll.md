## Making a Roll

When the GM determines that a roll is necessary, they first identify the **skill** (or **trick**) and **ability score** to use. Then they determine the base **Difficulty Level** for the roll. The Difficulty Level is adjusted up and down, as described in **Adjusting the Difficulty Level** below. Then you roll **2d10**, add your **ability score** along with any other **bonuses** that apply and compare the result to the **outcomes chart** to determine the outcome of the roll. If you used a trick, look at its specific outcomes chart. Otherwise, if it was an **improvised trick**, look at the **universal outcomes chart** and to the GM for adjudication.

### Skills and Tricks

When the GM calls you for you to make a skill roll, you will usually use the skill's **core trick** unless you have a **signature trick** that applies. You can use any skill's core tricks without having a bonus in that skill. You can't use signature tricks unless you know them. However, if you want to try something these rules don't cover, the GM can allow it under the rules for improvised tricks.

#### Ability Score

All skills and their tricks are associated with a primary ability. For example, the Intimidate skill and its tricks use Presence as their primary ability. Each ability has a **natural ability score** between 1 and 5. This can be increased with cyberware or psionic mutation by up to +3, for a maximum **augmented ability score** of 8.

Even though each skill has its own primary ability, the GM might decide to call for another ability to be used if it's appropriate, such as asking the player to roll Strength with Intimidate when they try to literally strongarm someone into compliance.

You always add one ability score to the rolls you make. 

#### Skill Bonus

During character creation, and later in the game when you can spend XP, you can put points into skills to give them a bonus. Each skill can have up to a +3 bonus. You can still make a roll to use a skill's core trick, even if you have no bonus in that skill. Bonuses that come from skills are called **skill bonuses**.

#### Gear Bonus

Your weapons and equipment can grant **gear bonuses** to specific skills (up to +3). For example, a weapon with a laser sight gives a +1 gear bonus to Firearms.

#### Aug Bonus

Your cyberware or psionic mutations can grant **aug bonuses** to specific skills (up to +3). For example, a pheromone pump grants a +1 aug bonus to Persuade.

#### Luck Bonus

You can spend a **luck point** and choose a skill to get a +2 **luck bonus** to all rolls you make with that skill for the rest of your turn. If the chosen skill is a **favored skill**, you get a +3 luck bonus instead.

### Stacking Bonuses

For any roll, apply one **ability score**, one **skill bonus**, one **gear bonus**, one **aug bonus**, and one **luck bonus**. You always add one ability score, but you might not have all (or any) of these bonuses, in which case, you don't apply them. 

Bonuses of the same type that target the same skill do not stack, and only the highest one applies. For example, if you have two pieces of gear that both give a gear bonus to Firearms, only the higher of the two bonuses is applied.
