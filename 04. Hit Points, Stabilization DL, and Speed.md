# Hit Points

Your character's health is measured in hit points (hp) and is based on your Strength and Resilience scores.

All characters get 10 hp (base) and add (Strength x 3) and (Resilience x 4).

For example, a character with Strength 2 and Resilience 4 would have:

| Step | Hit Point Calculation                                     |
|:----:|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | 10 (Base) + (Strength 2 x 3) + (Resilience 4 x 4) = Maximum hit points |
| 2    | 10 (Base) + 6 + 16                                        |
| 3    | 10 (Base) + 22                                            |
| 4    | 32 hp Max                                                 |
 
To calculate your Health Levels, do the following:

| Health Level    | Hit Points           | Example with 32 hp Max |
|:----------------|:---------------------|:-----------------------|
| Healthy         | Max Hit Points       | 32 hp                  |
| Wounded         | Half of Healthy      | 16 hp                  |
| Severely Wounded| Half of Wounded      | 8 hp                   |
| Death's Door    | Half of Severely<br>Wounded | 4 hp                   |
# Stabilization DL

Your character sheet has an area for you to write your Stabilization DL. This is the Difficulty Level used for a First Aid roll to apply the \[Stabilized\] condition to your character.

Your Stabilization DL is based on your Resilience score, as shown below.

| Resilience Score | Stabilization DL |
|:----------------:|:-----------------|
| 1                | Extreme (22)     |
| 2                | Severe (18)      |
| 3                | Hard (14)        |
| 4                | Moderate (10)    |
| 5                | Easy (6)         |
| 6                | Automatic (2)    |
# \[Speed\] and \[Half-Speed\]

Your character has two derived scores called \[Speed\] and \[Half-Speed\], which determine how far you can move in combat.
## \[Half-Speed\]

Your character's \[Half-Speed\] is equal to the sum of your character's Strength and Agility scores. Your \[Speed\] score is equal to \[Half-Speed\], multiplied by two.

For example, a character with a Strength of 2 and an Agility of 3 would have a \[Half-Speed\] as follows:

| Step | \[Half-Speed\] Score Calculation                      |
|:----:|:------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Strength 2 + Agility 3 = \[Half-Speed\] score in meters |
| 2    | 2 + 3                                                 |
| 3    | 5                                                     |
| 4    | \[Half-Speed\]: 5 meters                              |
## \[Speed\]

To calculate your character's \[Speed\], multiply your \[Half-Speed\] by two, as follows:

| Step | \[Speed\] Score Calculation                       |
|:----:|:--------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | \[Half-Speed\] 5 x 2 = \[Speed\] score in meters |
| 2    | 5 x 2                                             |
| 3    | 10                                                |
| 4    | \[Speed\]: 10 meters                              |

In combat, you can spend 1 AP to move a number of meters equal to your \[Speed\] score. For example, a character with a \[Speed\] of 10 can travel up to 10 meters in combat by spending 1 AP on their turn. You may spend 2 AP to move twice or 3 AP to move three times.

Certain conditions and effects limit you to using only \[Half-Speed\] action for 1 AP, or they may prevent you from completing your movement, stopping you mid-movement at your \[Half-Speed\] point.
