*You turn to an individual and look them in the eye. Maybe you say a few words, or you might just let your body language do the talking. Regardless, they are left broken from the brief exchange.* 

If you use Frighten without speaking, raise the DL by one. You cannot use this trick on someone who is currently suffering from a \[Break\].
