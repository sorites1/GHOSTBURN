# Skills and Tricks

There are fifteen **skills** in this game, three for each of the core five ability scores (Presence, Awareness, Agility, Intelligence, and Strength). There are several **tricks** associated with each skill. 

## Skills

Each skill covers a broad area of expertise and can be used to perform a variety of actions that fall under the skill's domain. These actions are defined in the rules and are called **tricks**, but when you try to do something not covered by the rules, the GM can allow it as an **improvised trick**.  and though each skill has a **primary ability score** associated with it, the GM should feel free to use new pairings if it makes sense. 

For example, to see if a character knows the kind of battery used by a specific model car, the GM could call for a Drive roll and have the player to use their Intelligence score, even though the primary ability score for Drive is Agility. 

### Skill Bonuses

Each of your skills can have a **skill bonus** (up to +3). Add your skill bonus to your roll when you use a trick governed by that skill. 

New characters start the game with a +1 bonus to a few skills. Later, once you've played the game and been award some **experience points (XP)**, you can spend those points to pick up a +1 bonus in a new skill or increase an existing bonus (up to +3). This is covered in the Experience Points section of these rules.

## Tricks

A **trick** is a specific use of a skill. There are three types of tricks in this game: **core tricks**, **signature tricks**, and **improvised tricks**. Core tricks and signature tricks include their own outcomes, as well as additional rules for their use. When a player wants to try something not covered by the rules, the GM can allow it as an improvised trick. 

### Core Tricks

Each skill has one or more core tricks. For example, First Aid is a core trick of the Medicine skill. A core trick includes its own outcomes chart that tells you exactly how to interpret the results. This is done to provide a consistent and efficient play experience for common in-game situations, such as needing to to stabilize a friend who has just suffered a grievous injury in combat.

#### You May Use Any Core Trick

You are allowed to use any core trick without penalty. Even if you have no skill bonus, you can still roll and add your ability score. 

### Signature Tricks

Signature tricks are specialized uses of your skills. They work just like core tricks except you can only use a signature trick if your character has learned it. New characters start the game with two signature tricks selected during character creation. You can learn new signature tricks by purchasing them with XP.

### Improvised Tricks

When these rules don't cover an action a player wants their character to perform, the GM can allow the player to make a roll and declare it an improvised trick. The GM is responsible for setting the Difficulty Level and determining the outcomes. The GM should feel free to work with the players to identify the outcomes, and they should be publicly shared with everyone at the table before the player makes their roll.
