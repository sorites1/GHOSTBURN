*When you pick up your scalpel and enter the surgical theater, it is no exaggeration to say that you save lives.* 

Refer to the injury's description to determine the DL for using Surgery to treat it and to see if it qualifies for Surgery in the field. If you perform Surgery in the field, raise the DL by one. You cannot use Surgery on someone who is \[[[Condition_Bleeding|Bleeding]]\], \[[[Condition_Traumatized|Traumatized]]\] or in \[[[Condition_Critical_Condition|Critical Condition]]\]. The patient must be \[[[Condition_Stabilized|Stabilized]]\] with First Aid to remove those conditions before Surgery can be performed. You may treat multiple injuries on the same target during the same surgical session, but you must roll separately for each one. It does not matter the order you treat them in. You cannot use this trick on yourself.
