| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill | Keywords                                             |
| --------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Hard (20)             | Drive | \[Physical\], \[Two Hands\], \[Vehicle\], \[Visual\] |

*When you're behind the wheel, you are capable of pulling off daring high-speed stunts that threaten to break the laws of physics.* 

To use this trick, you must be driving a \[Vehicle\] at \[High Speed\] (but this does not raise the DL as it normally would). When you use Driving Stunt, state your desired outcome, such as *I want to jump the draw bridge while it's opening* or *I want to tilt my car so it's almost on its side and I can go through a narrow alley.* If you only use \[One Hand\] with Driving Stunt, raise the DL by one.

| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Glitch       | Your \[Vehicle\] \[Crashes\]                                    |
| Fade         | You get the desired outcome but your \[Vehicle\] takes 5 damage |
| Success      | You get the desired outcome                                     |
| Cool Success | You get the desired outcome and you are \[Lucky\]               |
