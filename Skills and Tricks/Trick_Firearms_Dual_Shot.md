*You blast away with two guns, one in each hand.* 

To use Dual Shot, you must be equipped with two identical pistols or SMGs. When you use Dual Shot, you may target the same opponent with both weapons or two different opponents who are \[Nearby\] to each other. Your opponent(s) must be at the same range as the optimal range listed for your weapon. If they are at a different range, raise the DL by one (only once). Use the Single Shot \[Damage Array\] from one of your weapons. If you use burst mode, use the Burst Fire \[Damage Array\] from one of your weapons and raise the DL by one.
