*You exploit a moment of distraction to steal a small item from a person's pocket, wrist, or finger.* 

When someone who is \[Close\] to you becomes \[Distracted\], you may use a \[Reaction\] to use Pickpocket. You may optionally use this trick to Reverse Pickpocket, which allows you to plant an item on a person rather than steal one from them. Instead of targeting a person, you may also use Pickpocket to discretely lift or drop a \[Small Item\] from an unattended surface that is \[Close\], such as a palming a key off a desk or dropping a knife in a waste basket. If multiple observers are present, use the highest Wits among them.
