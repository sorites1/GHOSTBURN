| Hard (20)             | Deception | \[Advanced Supplies\], \[Physical\], \[Supplies\], \[Two Hands\] |

*Using clothing, makeup, and props, you create a disguise that makes you unrecognizable.*

When you use Disguise, you use \[Supplies\] or \[Advanced Supplies\] to create the desired look. \[Advanced Supplies\] allow you replicate another person's appearance and raise the DL by one. This trick takes one hour to complete. If you rush, raise the DL by one and it takes 30 minutes.
