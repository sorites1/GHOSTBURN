*You are well aware of the equipment, tactics, and methods employed by milsec personnel.* 

When you use Milsec Culture, you ask the GM a question related to milsec (military/security). For example, before infiltrating a corporate compound, you might ask, *What's a typical response for this corp's security guards? Are they going to shoot first and ask questions later?* or *Are these guards well trained or just scrubs with guns?* The scope of this trick is limited to information about milsec, including law enforcement, corporate security, and military assets.
