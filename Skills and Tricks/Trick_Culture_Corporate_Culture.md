*You are plugged in to the corporate world of cutthroat business.* 

When you use Corporate Culture, you ask the GM a question related to business, banking, or corporations. For example, getting hired to kidnap an exec may prompt you to ask, *What do I know about Knifepoint Capital?* or *What corporations  might have a beef with Knifepoint Capital?* The scope of this trick is limited to information about corporations, their operations, locations, and employees.
