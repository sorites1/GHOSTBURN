*When your opponent falls behind, you seize the opportunity and drive your car out of sight to lose them completely.* 

When you are driving a \[Vehicle\] that's the target of a Chase and your opponent falls behind, you may use a \[Reaction\] to Escape. The \[Handling\] of your \[Vehicle\] applies to the DL of your Lose Them roll. If you use only \[One Hand\], raise the DL by one.
