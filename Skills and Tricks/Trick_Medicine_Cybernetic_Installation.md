*Surgery might be more glamorous, but knowing how to install cyberware saves just about as many lives in the sprawl.* 

You cannot use Cybernetic Installation on someone who is \[Bleeding\], \[Traumatized\], or in \[Critical Condition\]. The patient must be \[Stabilized\] with First Aid to remove those conditions before Cybernetic Installation can be performed. You may install multiple pieces of cyberware on the same target during the same \[Surgical Procedure\], but you must roll separately for each one. It does not matter the order you install them in. You cannot use this trick on yourself.
