*In a split second, you react to an oncoming hazard and swerve to avoid a crash.* 

When you are driving a \[Vehicle\] at \[High Speed\] and a sudden obstacle or hazard appears on the road ahead or if your vehicle \[Crashes\] for another reason, you can use a \[Reaction\] to use Avoid Crash. The \[Handling\] of your \[Vehicle\] applies to the DL of your Avoid Crash roll. If you use only \[One Hand\], raise the DL by one.
