*Sitting on the side of the road, you remotely pilot a drone and use it to collect intel on your target.*

When you use Drone Recon to scout a location, state the scope of your search, such as *I want to fly up to the 38th floor and see if I can find the room we're looking for*, or *I want to do a flyover of the area and see where the security guards are stationed*. The Difficulty Level is based on the \[Security\] of the airspace you are in.

### Drone Piloting Sidebar

*You connect your control deck to a drone over wireless and create a 3D Tactical Hologram (TDTH) using its cameras. Flying a drone is cognitively demanding and requires intense focus. To ensure they can concentrate, some pilots convert TDTH to VR and wear a headset to block out all potential distractions. Others go a step further and send the signal straight to their brains using a datajack.*
