| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill | Keywords                                                                  |

*You spot the car you're chasing up ahead and rapidly accelerate to catch up.* 

When you use Chase, you identify a target \[Vehicle\] ahead of you (\[Nearby\] or \[Far\]). If the other \[Vehicle\] is traveling at \[High Speed\], you must do the same (which raises the DL by one). If the other \[Vehicle\] is \[Far\] away, raise the DL by one. The \[Handling\] of your \[Vehicle\] applies to the DL of your Chase roll. If you use only \[One Hand\], raise the DL by one.
