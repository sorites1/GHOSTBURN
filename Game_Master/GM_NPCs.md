# NPCs

Non-Player Characters, or NPCs, are managed by the GM. They are contacts, enemies, and everyday people you might see on the street. 

## NPC Traits

NPCs have three traits: \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Wits|Wits]]\], \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Fort|Fort]]\], and \[[[Keywords/Keyword_Threat|Threat]]\]. 

### Wits and Fort

\[Wits\] represent the NPC's intelligence, awareness, and critical thinking. When a player uses a trick to manipulate or deceive an NPC, they roll against the NPC's \[Wits\].

\[Fort\], short for Fortitude, represents the NPC's willpower, grit, and determination. When a player uses a trick to intimidate an NPC, they roll against the NPC's \[Fort\].

\[Wits\] and \[Fort\] are each expressed as a \[[[PtG_Difficulty_Level|Difficulty Level]]\] based on how hard or easy it is to manipulate or intimidate the NPC. For example, a snooty *maître d'* who notices everything but who is also a coward might have a \[Wits\] of Hard (20) and a \[Fort\] of Easy (8).

### Threat

\[Threat\] represents an NPC's overall competence and the danger they pose to the player characters. As its name implies, the more capable the NPC, the higher their \[Threat\]. 

\[Threat\] is expressed as a bonus of between +1 and +20. When the GM rolls for the NPC, they add \[Threat\] to get the result. \[Threat\] is used for all NPC rolls. 

The GM can assign a \[Threat\] based on the table below, or they use the rules for [[GM_Calculating_Threat|Calculating Threat]] to derive a bonus from the NPC's \[Wits\] and \[Fort\].

| NPC Tier         | Threat Range   | Examples                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Typical**      | **+1 to +6**   | Street Vendor, Patrol Cop, Gang Member                        |
| **Professional** | **+7 to +12**  | Forever Wars Veteran, Megacorp Security, Yakuza Bodyguard     |
| **Elite**        | **+13 to +17** | Megacorp Elite Guard, Chromed Yakuza Assassin                 |
| **Ultra**        | **+18 to +20** | Megacorp Ultra Elite Guard, Unstoppable Killer Robot. Godlike |

## NPC Hit Points

NPCs have hit points equal to their \[Threat\] x 5. For example, an NPC with a \[Threat\] of +1 has 10 HP, a \[Threat\] of +7 yields 35 HP, and a \[Threat\] of +13 gives the NPC 65 HP. 

### NPC Health Levels

An NPC has four health levels, as described below.

| NPC Health Level | NPC Hit Points     | Penalty           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uninjured        | Max HP             | None              | NPC has full hit points. No penalties.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Hurt             | At or Below 50% HP | DLs Raised by one | NPC has half (or less) of their hit points remaining. DLs are raised by one.                                                                                                                      |
| Defeated         | At or Below 10% HP | Cannot Make Rolls | NPC has 10% (or less) of their hit points remaining. NPC is dead or nearly so. They cannot make rolls, though they may be able to take actions like crawling or speaking, at the GM's discretion. |

### NPC Health Array

To make it easier to track NPC health, the GM can use an NPC Health Array, which looks like this (for an NPC with a \[Threat\] of +13): 65/33/7. This represents the NPC's max hit points, the level at which they are \[Hurt\] and have their DLs raised by one, and the point at which they ae \[Defeated\], respectively. 

## NPC Skills and Tricks

NPCs don't have skills (or skill bonuses) like player characters do. They use \[Threat\] instead.. However, NPCs do use tricks. Just like a player, an NPC can make a roll using any of the core tricks presented in these rules. If the NPC knows a signature trick, it should be listed in their stat block. 

## NPC Gear

NPCs have access to gear, including armor and weapons. An NPC's gear should be listed in their stat block.

## NPC Augments

NPCs often have augments, which the GM is encouraged to describe (assuming the augments are visible), but they do not alter the NPC's traits. An NPC who has a \[Threat\] of +7 does not "get stronger" and see an increase to +8 if the GM describes them as having muscle replacements. Augments that provide other types of functionality, including those which modify the DL of a roll, can be used by NPCs as normal and should be noted in their stat block.
