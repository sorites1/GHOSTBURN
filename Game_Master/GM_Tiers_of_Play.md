# Tiers of Play

There are three tiers of play in this game, as shown in the table below. This table is meant to help the GM understand how effective a character's bonus will be in overcoming a given \[[[PtG_Difficulty_Level|Difficulty Level]]\]. Savvy players will find ways to lower the DL, which can allow them to punch above their weight, so to speak.

| Character Tier | Bonus Range    | Their "Standard" Challenge | Their "Hard" Challenge |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Rookie**     | **+1 to +6**   | Moderate (14)              | Hard (20)              |
| **Expert**     | **+7 to +12**  | Hard (20)                  | Severe (26)            |
| **Veteran**    | **+13 to +17** | Severe (26)                | Extreme (32)           |

For example, a character with a bonus of +5 (including ability score, gear bonus, and aug bonus) is considered a Rookie. When making rolls with that bonus, the player will regularly overcome a \[Difficulty Level\] of Moderate (14), but their results against a Hard (20) will be hit and miss. A \[Difficulty Level\] of Severe (26) or higher will be nigh impossible, unless the crew has a way to lower the DL.

As characters gain XP, upgrade their gear, and install new augments, their bonuses can be increased. As a character progresses into the Expert and Veteran tiers, they will be capable of handling higher DLs.
