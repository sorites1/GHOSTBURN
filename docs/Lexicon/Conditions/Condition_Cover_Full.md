# Cover, Full

**Cause:** Your body is fully behind a solid object, and you are in now way exposed, making it impossible to see you or make an [[Attack](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Attack.md)] against you. It is possible to have \[Cover, Full\] to one observer and not another.

**Effect:** Attacks made against you by an observer to whom you have \[Cover, Full\] automatically fail.

**Removal:** When you become fully exposed to an observer or gain [[Cover, Partial](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Cover_Partial.md)] to them, you no longer have \[Cover, Full\] to them.
