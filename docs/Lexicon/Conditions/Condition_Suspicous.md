# Suspicious

**Cause:** When you sense that someone may be lying, hiding something, or mispresenting the truth, you are \[Suspicious\]. This condition cannot be applied to player characters.

**Effect:** If you have a [[Friendly](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Friendly.md)] [[Attitude](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Attitude.md)] it worsens to [[Neutral](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Neutral.md)]. [[Social](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Social.md)] skills and tricks used against you have their DL raised by one. If the person you are \[Suspicious\] of is using a [Disguise](../../Skills_and_Tricks/Deception/Disguise.md) or a [Forgery](../../Skills_and_Tricks/Deception/Forgery.md), you may attempt to see through it. To see through a Disguise or Forgery, the GM makes a [Threat](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Threat.md) roll for the NPC and uses the DL set by the outcome the player achieved on their Disguise or Forgery roll.

**Removal:** If the subject of your suspicions improves your \[Attitude\] to \[Friendly\], you lose \[Suspicious\].
