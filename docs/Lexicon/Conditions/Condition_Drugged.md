# Drugged

**Cause:** When a chemical interferes with your ability to move, speak, and think, you are \[Drugged\].

**Effect:** You gain [[Cognitive Impairment](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Cognitive_Impairment.md)], [[Movement Impaired](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Movement_Impaired.md)], [[Off Balance](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Off_Balance.md)], [[Off Guard](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Off_Guard.md)], [[Speech Impairment](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Speech_Impairment.md)], and [[Vision Impairment](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Vision_Impairment.md)].

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, make a [[Basic](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Basic.md)] Resilience roll with a DL of Moderate (14). Success means you lose the \[Drugged\] condition. If you are still \[Drugged\] at the end of the scene, you lose \[Drugged\]. If you are given an antidote for the chemical affecting you, you lose \[Drugged\] immediately.
