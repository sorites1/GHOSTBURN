# Foggy

**Cause:** When a lingering haze fills the air, obscuring people and objects in the distance, it is \[Foggy\].

**Effect:** Without some kind of imaging enhancement like \[[[Mod_Clearview|Clearview]]\], it is impossible to identify targets at [[Far](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Far.md)] range (or beyond \[Far\] with a [[Scope](../../Gear_and_Augments/Firearms/Firearms_Mods/Scope.md)]) when it is \[Foggy\]. Targets who are [[Nearby](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Nearby.md)] have [[Concealment, Partial](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial.md)]. Targets who are [[Close](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Close.md)] are unaffected.

**Removal:** When the fog thins or dissipates in an area, it loses \[Foggy\].
