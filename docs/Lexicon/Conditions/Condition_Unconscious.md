# Unconscious

**Cause:** When you gain the [[Dying](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Dying.md)] condition, you also gain \[Unconscious\]. You can also be rendered \[Unconscious\] by certain tricks or conditions.

**Effect:** You are [[Immobilized](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Immobilized.md)], [[Incapable](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Incapable.md)], [[Prone](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Prone.md)], [[Unaware](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Unaware.md)], and [[Unresponsive](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Unresponsive.md)].

**Removal:** If you are \[Dying\], you must be [[Stabilized](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Stabilized.md)] with at least 1 hp to lose the \[Unconscious\] condition. If another condition or effect caused you to become \[Unconscious\], and it has its own Removal, you must abide by it. If no other Removal is indicated, then at the start of your turn, make a [[Basic](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Basic.md)] Resilience or Threat roll with a DL of Easy (8). Success means you lose the \[Unconscious\] condition.
