# Traumatized

**Cause:** When you sustain an injury by rolling on the [Injury Level Chart](../../Characters/Health_and_Healing/Sustaining_an_Injury.md), you gain the \[Traumatized\] condition.

**Effect:** All tricks have their DL is raised by one. 

**Removal:** When you are [[Stabilized](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Stabilized.md)], you lose the \[Traumatized\] condition. If you are still \[Traumatized\] at the end of the current scene, you lose the \[Traumatized\] condition.
