# Movement Restricted

**Cause:** When a condition or injury makes it nearly impossible to move, you are \[Movement Restricted\]. This condition replaces [[Movement Impaired](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Movement_Impaired.md)].

**Effect:** It costs 3 AP to [[Move](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Move.md)] to an area [[Nearby](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Nearby.md)] or to use a trick with the \[Move\] keyword. You cannot make Athletics rolls.

**Removal:** When the condition that caused you to be \[Movement Restricted\] is removed, you lose the \[Movement Restricted\] condition. If you gained \[Movement Restricted\] as the result of an injury, receiving Surgery or Cybernetic Installation, as described in the Recovery entry of the injury description. causes you to lose \[Movement Restricted\].
