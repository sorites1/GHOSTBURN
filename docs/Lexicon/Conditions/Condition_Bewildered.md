# Bewildered

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or effect leaves you deeply and utterly confused, you are \[Bewildered\]. This counts as and replaces the [[Distracted](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Distracted.md)] condition.

**Effect:** Tricks used on you have their DL lowered by one and their outcomes are [[Upgraded](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Upgraded.md)].

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, you lose the \[Bewildered\] condition.
