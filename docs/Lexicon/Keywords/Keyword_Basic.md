# Basic

When the rules call for you to make a \[Basic\] roll, they indicate the skill or ability score to use and the [Difficulty Level](../../Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Difficulty_Level.md) for the roll. They also describe the consequence for getting a Success or Failure. Unlike most rolls in the game, a \[Basic\] roll has only two outcomes (Success and Failure), and the text only describes one of those two outcomes (because it is the only outcome that has a consequence attached).
