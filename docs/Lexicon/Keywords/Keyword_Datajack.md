# Datajack

A cybernetic implant used to directly interface with devices and systems, such as a [[Cyber Rig](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Cyber_Rig.md)] or [[Drone](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Drone.md)]. When you are jacked in, you gain the [[Unaware](../../Lexicon/Conditions/Condition_Unaware.md)] condition.
