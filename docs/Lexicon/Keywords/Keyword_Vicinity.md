# Vicinity

This trick tracks the proximity of people to one another. Indoors, you and another person are in the same \[Vicinity\] if you are [[Nearby](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Nearby.md)], such as in the same a room, hallway, etc. Outdoors, the \[Vicinity\] is limited to being [[Close](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Close.md)] to the other person.
