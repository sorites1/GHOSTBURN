# Luck Bonus

After you [make a roll](../../Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Making_a_Roll.md), you can spend a [[Luck Point](../../Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Luck_Points.md)] to get a +2 Luck Bonus to your roll result. If the roll uses one of your Favored Skills, you get a +3 Luck Bonus instead.
