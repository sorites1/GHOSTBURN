# Incompatible

Two things that cannot work together are \[Incompatible\]. When you encounter this keyword, it will be in reference to two things, such as two augments or a weapon and a mod. For example, [[Dermal Armor](../../Gear_and_Augments/Augments/Combat_Augments/Dermal_Armor.md)] and [[Subdermal Nanoweave](../../Gear_and_Augments/Augments/Combat_Augments/Subdermal_Nanoweave.md)] are \[Incompatible\], which means if you have one installed, you cannot install the other.
