# Control Deck

A piece of hardware used to control drones and vehicles. 

To connect a \[Control Deck\] to a [[Drone](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Drone.md)] or [[Vehicle](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle.md)] so you can control it, you must have [[Admin](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Admin.md)] access to it. You automatically have this access on any drone or vehicle you own. 

You may use a \[Control Deck\] to remotely control a \[Drone\] or \[Vehicle\] over [[Wireless](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Wireless.md)]. This requires you to either wear a connected [[Control Helmet](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Control_Helmet.md)] (included when you buy a \[Control Deck\]) or connect using the [Control Port](../../Gear_and_Augments/Augments/Utility_Augments/Control_Port.md) augment.

Some vehicles have a \[Control Deck\] integrated into their onboard controls. Such a \[Vehicle\] allows you to [[Strap In](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Strap_In.md)] if you have the \[Control Port\] augment.
