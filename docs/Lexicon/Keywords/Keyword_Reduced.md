# Reduced

To determine \[Reduced\] damage, use the next worse value from the weapon's [[Damage Array](../../Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Damage_Array.md)] compared to the damage generated by the outcome of the roll. \[Reduced\] damage cannot be lower than 1.

In other words, [[Maximum Damage](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Maximum_Damage.md)] is \[Reduced\] to [[Normal Damage](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage.md)], \[Normal Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to [[Minimum Damage](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage.md)], and \[Minimum Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to [[Absolute Damage](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Absolute_Damage.md)].
