# Damage Array

Damage for a weapon or an unarmed brawl attack is expressed as a \[Damage Array\], which is a set of three numbers, separated by slashes, such as 5/10/25. These are the [[Minimum Damage](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage.md)], [[Normal Damage](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage.md)], and [[Maximum Damage](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Maximum_Damage.md)] values, respectively.
