## Move

When you use \[Move\], you spend 1 AP per range increment you want to go. For example, to go from the kitchen to the living room is \[[[Keyword_Close|Close]]\] to \[[[Keyword_Nearby|Nearby]]\] so that is 1 AP. To go from the kitchen to the outside and across the street is \[Close\] to \[Nearby\] (1 AP) and then \[Nearby\] to \[[[Keyword_Far|far]]\] (1 AP), so that is 2 AP.
