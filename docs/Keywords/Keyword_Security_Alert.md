# Security Alert

A \[Security Alert\] is issued when an intruder is detected by a device, system, or person, such as a guard calling in an alert. 

In the case of a device or system, a \[Security Alert\] is issued when a hacker is detected. It forcibly dumps the user that triggered the \[Security Alert\] and notifies the [[Admin](/../Keywords/Keyword_Admin)], as well as possibly executing a lockdown process and reporting the user's physical location to the appropriate security personnel. 

When an intruder is detected at a physical location, the response varies based on its defense capabilities. A retail store will likely just autodial local law enforcement, whereas a megacorp is sure to have an array of resources and techniques it can choose from when forming its response.
