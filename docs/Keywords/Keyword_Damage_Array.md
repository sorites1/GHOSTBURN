# Damage Array

Damage for a weapon or an unarmed brawl attack is expressed as a \[Damage Array\], which is a set of three numbers, separated by slashes, such as 5/10/25. These are the \[Minimum Damage](../[Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage.md)], [[Normal Damage](../Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage.md)], and \[Maximum Damage](../[Keywords/Keyword_Maximum_Damage.md)] values, respectively.
