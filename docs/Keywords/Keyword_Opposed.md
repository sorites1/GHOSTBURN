# Opposed

This trick uses an \[Opposed\] roll to determine the outcome instead of the standard resolution process. 

You roll just like you normally do. The GM rolls 2d10 and adds the NPC's [[Threat](../Keywords/Keyword_Threat.md)] bonus. Compare your result to the GM's result. If your result is 4 or more higher than the GM's roll, it's a Cool Success. If you get 1-3 higher than the GM's roll, it is a Success. If your result is equal to the GM's roll, it's a Fade. Lower than the GM's roll and it's a Glitch.
