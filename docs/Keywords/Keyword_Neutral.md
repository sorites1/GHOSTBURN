 Neutral

When an NPC has an [[Attitude](../Keywords/Keyword_Attitude.md)] of \[Neutral\] towards you, they are ambivalent towards you. They are willing to do business with you and will engage you in small talk, but they are not interested in doing you any favors.

If an NPC's \[Attitude\] is \[Neutral\] and it improves, it moves to \[Friendly\]. If it worsens, it moves to \[Hostile\].
