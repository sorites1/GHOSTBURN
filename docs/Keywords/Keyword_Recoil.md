# Recoil

A [[Firearm](/../Keywords/Keyword_Firearm)] with \[Recoil\] is more difficult to shoot multiple times on the same turn. When you use a weapon with \[Recoil\], every [[Attack](/../Keywords/Keyword_Attack)] you make beyond the first with the same weapon on the same turn has its [Difficulty Level](/../PtG_Difficulty_Level) raised by one. This DL increase is cumulative. \[Recoil\] is a [[Weapon Type](/../Keywords/Keyword_Weapon_Types)] characteristic and is found on Heavy Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, and SMGs. 

For example, the Desert Viper is a Heavy Pistol, which means it has the \[Recoil\] trait. The first shot with the Desert Viper using the [Single Shot](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Firearms_Core_Single_Shot) trick has a DL of Moderate (14). The second shot (with Single Shot) on the same turn has a DL of Hard (20), and the third shot has a DL of Severe (26).
