## Reaction

This trick is used in response to a trigger defined in its description. When the condition for the trigger occurs, you may use this trick even if it's not your turn. \[Reaction\] actions are free and do not have an AP cost. However, you can only use a number of \[Reaction\] actions each turn equal to your Agility score.
