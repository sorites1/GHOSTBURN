# Control Helmet

A helmet designed for use with a [[Control Deck](/../Keywords/Keyword_Control_Deck)], often stylized with an opaque visor. A \[Control Helmet\] is [[Incompatible](/../Keywords/Keyword_Incompatible)] with the [Control Port](/../Cybernetic_Augments/Aug_Control_Port) augment. That is, if you have a \[Control Port\] augment, you have no need for a \[Control Helmet\].
