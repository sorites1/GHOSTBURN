# Control Helmet

A helmet designed for use with a [[Control Deck](../Keywords/Keyword_Control_Deck.md)], often stylized with an opaque visor. A \[Control Helmet\] is [[Incompatible](../Keywords/Keyword_Incompatible.md)] with the [Control Port](../Cybernetic_Augments/Aug_Control_Port.md) augment. That is, if you have a \[Control Port\] augment, you have no need for a \[Control Helmet\].
