# Optimal Range

A [[Firearm](../Keywords/Keyword_Firearm.md)] has an attribute called \[Optimal Range\]. A weapon's \[Optimal Range\] is one of the [[Range](../Keywords/Keyword_Range.md)] values: [[Close](../Keywords/Keyword_Close.md)], [[Nearby](../Keywords/Keyword_Nearby.md)], and [[Far](../Keywords/Keyword_Far.md)]. If you make an [[Attack](../Keywords/Keyword_Attack.md)] against a target at a \[Range\] other than the \[Optimal Range\], raise the DL by one for each range increment the target is away from the \[Optimal Range\]. For example, if your weapon has an \[Optimal Range\] of \[Far\], and you try to hit a target that is \[Nearby\], the DL is raised by one. To hit a target that is \[Close\] would mean the DL is raised by two.
