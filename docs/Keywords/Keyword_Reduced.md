# Reduced

To determine \[Reduced\] damage, use the next worse value from the weapon's [[Damage Array](/../GaA_Damage_Array)] compared to the damage generated by the outcome of the roll. \[Reduced\] damage cannot be lower than 1.

In other words, [[Maximum Damage](/../Keywords/Keyword_Maximum_Damage)] is \[Reduced\] to [[Normal Damage](/../Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage)], \[Normal Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to [[Minimum Damage](/../Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage)], and \[Minimum Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to [[Absolute Damage](/../Keywords/Keyword_Absolute_Damage)].
