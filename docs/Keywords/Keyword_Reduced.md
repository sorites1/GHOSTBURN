# Reduced

To determine \[Reduced\] damage, use the next worse value from the weapon's [[Damage Array](../GaA_Damage_Array.md)] compared to the damage generated by the outcome of the roll. \[Reduced\] damage cannot be lower than 1.

In other words, [[Maximum Damage](../Keywords/Keyword_Maximum_Damage.md)] is \[Reduced\] to [[Normal Damage](../Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage.md)], \[Normal Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to [[Minimum Damage](../Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage.md)], and \[Minimum Damage\] is \[Reduced\] to [[Absolute Damage](../Keywords/Keyword_Absolute_Damage.md)].
