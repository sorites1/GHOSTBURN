## Gear Bonus

Your weapons and equipment can grant gear bonuses to specific skills (up to +3). For example, a laser sight gives a +1 gear bonus to Firearms. 

Multiple gear bonuses do not stack, and only the highest gear bonus is applied. For example, if you have have a piece of gear that gives a +1 gear bonus to Firearms and another that gives a +2 gear bonus to Firearms, only the +2 gear bonus applies to your Firearms rolls.
