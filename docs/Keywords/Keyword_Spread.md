# Spread

When you make an [[Attack](/../Keywords/Keyword_Attack)] with a shotgun, it uses \[Spread\] to hit multiple targets that are [[Close](/../Keywords/Keyword_Close)] to one another. To determine which targets are hit, first identify the primary target. Then, look for additional targets that are \[Close\] to the primary and which are not behind [[Cover, Full](/../Conditions/Condition_Cover_Full)] or [[Cover, Partial](/../Conditions/Condition_Cover_Partial)] (including being behind other people). \[Spread\] can affect up to two additional targets, and you cannot choose to avoid hitting them. If the outcome of the \[Attack\] damage to the primary target, it deals \[Reduced](/../[Keywords/Keyword_Reduced)]\] damage to each additional target as well. You cannot choose to avoid hitting additional targets. 

Also, a weapon with \[Spread\] cannot be used to \[Attack\] targets at [[Far](/../Keywords/Keyword_Far)] range.

For example, you use a Graham H6 shotgun to make an \[Attack\] against a target. There are two additional targets standing \[Close\] to the first (primary) target. You make your Firearms roll to use [Single Shot](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Firearms_Core_Single_Shot) and score a Success, which deals [[Normal Damage](/../Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage)]. The H6's [[Damage Array](/../GaA_Damage_Array)] for Single Shot is 9/18/45, so the \[Normal Damage\] is 18. The primary target takes 18 points of damage. The two additional targets take damage from the next step down on the \[Damage Array\], which is \[Minimum Damage\]. The H6's \[Minimum Damage\] is 9, so the two additional targets each take 9 points of damage.
