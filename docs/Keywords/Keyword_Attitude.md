# Attitude

\[Attitude\] is an NPC trait. It represents how an NPC feels about a particular person. \[Attitude\] can be thought of as a spectrum with three values: [[Friendly](../Keywords/Keyword_Friendly.md)], [[Neutral](../Keywords/Keyword_Neutral.md)], and [[Hostile](../Keywords/Keyword_Hostile.md)]. Some tricks cause a target's \[Attitude\] to go improve or worsen.
