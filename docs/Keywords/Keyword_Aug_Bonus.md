## Aug Bonus

Your cybernetic augments or psionic mutations can grant aug bonuses to specific skills (up to +3). For example, a pheromone pump grants a +1 aug bonus to Persuade.

Multiple aug bonuses do not stack, and only the highest gear bonus is applied. For example, if you have have a piece of cybernetics that gives a +1 aug bonus to Persuade and another that gives a +2 aug bonus to Persuade, only the +2 aug bonus applies to your Persuade rolls.
