 Hostile

When an NPC has an [[Attitude](../Keywords/Keyword_Attitude.md)] of \[Hostile\] towards you, they are discourteous and unkind to you, and they might even [[Attack](../Keywords/Keyword_Attack.md)] you. When you use a [[Social](../Keywords/Keyword_Social.md)] trick on a \[Hostile\] NPC, raise the DL by one.

If an NPC's \[Attitude\] is \[Hostile\] and something causes it to improve, it moves to \[Neutral\]. If something causes it to worsen, the target stays at Hostile gains the [[Break](../Conditions/Condition_Break.md)] condition.
