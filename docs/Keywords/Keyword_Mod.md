# Mod

A \[Mod\] is a special feature that can be installed into a cybernetic augment. When you install a \[Mod\] into a cybernetic augment, you only pay the Mesh Cost of the Mod that exceeds the Mesh Cost of the cybernetic augment.  

For example, [TGR Claws](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_TGR_Claws) have a Mesh Cost of 4, which must be paid when the augment is installed normally. However, if TGR Claws are installed in a Mod Slot in a [Cybernetic Arm](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Arm), which has a Mesh Cost of 5, you pay 0 Mesh for the TGR Claws because its Mesh Cost does not exceed the Mesh Cost of the Cybernetic Arm.

Here's another example. [Glide-By-Wire Reflexes (Level 3)](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Glide_By_Wire_Reflexes) have a Mesh Cost of 12, which must be paid when the augment is installed normally. However, if that same augment is installed as a \[Mod\] in a [Cybernetic Spine (Level 1)](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Spine), which has a Mesh Cost of 5, then you only pay 7 Mesh for it (because its Mesh Cost of 12 is 7 more than the Mesh Cost of 5 for the Cybernetic Spine in which the \[Mod\] is being installed).
