# Armor

If you're wearing armor when you take damage from an \[Attack\], the damage is [[Reduced](/../Keywords/Keyword_Reduced)]. If your armor is rated against the [[Weapon Group](/../Keyword_Weapon_Groups)] used to make the \[Attack\], the damage is \[Reduced\] again.

For example, say your character is wearing Soft Armor, which is rated against \[Small Arms\]. 

You are hit by an [EZTech Punisher Lite](/../Firearms/Firearms_LP_EZTech_Punisher_Lite) (which is belongs to the \[Small Arms\] weapon group) for [[Normal Damage](/../Keywords/Keyword_Normal_Damage)] of 10, Since you are wearing armor, the damage is [[Reduced](/../Keywords/Keyword_Reduced)] to [[Minimum Damage](/../Keywords/Keyword_Minimum_Damage)] of 5. Since your armor is rated against \[Small Arms\], the damage is \[Reduced\] again to [[Absolute Damage](/../Keywords/Keyword_Absolute_Damage)] of 1. 

On the other hand, when you are hit by a [Graham PX-90 Carbine](/../Firearms/Firearms_Rifle_Graham_PX90_Carbine) (Rifle) for \[Normal Damage\] of 18, the damage is \[Reduced\] to its \[Minimum Damage\] of 9. Since your armor is not rated against Rifles, the damage is not \[Reduced\] any further.
