# Control Deck

A piece of hardware used to control drones and vehicles. 

To connect a \[Control Deck\] to a [[Drone](/../Keywords/Keyword_Drone)] or [[Vehicle](/../Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle)] so you can control it, you must have [[Admin](/../Keywords/Keyword_Admin)] access to it. You automatically have this access on any drone or vehicle you own. 

You may use a \[Control Deck\] to remotely control a \[Drone\] or \[Vehicle\] over [[Wireless](/../Keywords/Keyword_Wireless)]. This requires you to either wear a connected [[Control Helmet](/../Keywords/Keyword_Control_Helmet)] (included when you buy a \[Control Deck\]) or connect using the [Control Port](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Control_Port) augment.

Some vehicles have a \[Control Deck\] integrated into their onboard controls. Such a \[Vehicle\] allows you to [[Strap In](/../Keywords/Keyword_Strap_In)] if you have the \[Control Port\] augment.
