# Aug Blade

\[Aug Blade] is a [[Weapon Type](/../Keywords/Keyword_Weapon_Types)]. It belongs to the [[Bladed](/../Keyword_Blades)] weapon group. The \[Aug Blade\] weapon type includes the following keywords: [[Brawl](/../Keywords/Keyword_Brawl)], [[Melee](/../Keywords/Keyword_Melee)], [[One Hand](/../Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand)], and [[Physical](/../Keywords/Keyword_Physical)]. 

Weapons with this \[Weapon Type\] use the Brawl skill to [[Attack](/../Keywords/Keyword_Attack)], but they use the Melee [Damage Array](/../Gear_and_Augments/GaA_Damage_Array) and can only use tricks from the Melee skill. 

For example, the [TGR Claws](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_TGR_Claws) augment is classified as an \[Aug Blade\]. To make an \[Attack\], you would [Make a Roll](/../Playing_the_Game/PtG_Making_a_Roll) using Brawl, but you would not use the [Unarmed Strike](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Brawl_Core_Unarmed_Strike) trick. Instead, you would choose from the tricks found in the Melee skill, such as [Melee Strike](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Melee_Core_Melee_Strike), [Dazzling Strike](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Melee_Dazzling_Strike), or [Leaping Strike](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Melee_Leaping_Strike).
