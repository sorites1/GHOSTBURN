# Aug Blade

\[Aug Blade] is a [[Weapon Type](../Keywords/Keyword_Weapon_Types.md)]. It belongs to the [[Bladed](../Keyword_Blades.md)] weapon group. The \[Aug Blade\] weapon type includes the following keywords: [[Brawl](../Keywords/Keyword_Brawl.md)], [[Melee](../Keywords/Keyword_Melee.md)], [[One Hand](../Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand.md)], and [[Physical](../Keywords/Keyword_Physical.md)]. 

Weapons with this \[Weapon Type\] use the Brawl skill to [[Attack](../Keywords/Keyword_Attack.md)], but they use the Melee [Damage Array](../Gear_and_Augments/GaA_Damage_Array.md) and can only use tricks from the Melee skill. 

For example, the [TGR Claws](../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_TGR_Claws.md) augment is classified as an \[Aug Blade\]. To make an \[Attack\], you would [Make a Roll](../Playing_the_Game/PtG_Making_a_Roll.md) using Brawl, but you would not use the [Unarmed Strike](../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Brawl_Core_Unarmed_Strike.md) trick. Instead, you would choose from the tricks found in the Melee skill, such as [Melee Strike](../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Melee_Core_Melee_Strike.md), [Dazzling Strike](../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Melee_Dazzling_Strike.md), or [Leaping Strike](../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Melee_Leaping_Strike.md).
