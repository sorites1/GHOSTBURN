# Admin

You have \[Admin\] access to a device or system. You can perform all the same functions as an [[Operator](../Keywords/Keyword_Operator.md)], but you also have full control and can make changes, such as performing a shutdown, locking out users, granting access to anyone you like, disabling alerts, modifying configurations, and so on.
