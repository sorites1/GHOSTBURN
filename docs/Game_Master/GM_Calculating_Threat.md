# Calculating Threat

An NPC's \[Threat\] can be derived from their \[Wits\] and \[Fort\]. For each \[Difficulty Level\], the GM chooses a Regular Bonus or a Strong Bonus from those listed in the table below. 

| Difficulty Level  | Regular Bonus | Strong Bonus |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| **Easy (8)**      | +1            | +2           |
| **Moderate (14)** | +3            | +4           |
| **Hard (20)**     | +5            | +6           |
| **Severe (26)**   | +7            | +8           |
| **Extreme (32)**  | +9            | +10          |

The GM should use the Regular Bonus for most NPCs. The Strong Bonus is reserved for versions of the NPC who are the best of the bunch. 

For example, a regular Patrol Cop has a \[Wits\] of Moderate (14) and a \[Fort\] of Moderate (14). Using the Regular Bonus for each yields +3 and +3, for a calculated \[Threat\] of +6. If the GM wants this NPC to be a *very competent* Patrol Cop, they can take the Strong Bonus instead, which would yield +4 and +4, for a \[Threat\] of +8.
