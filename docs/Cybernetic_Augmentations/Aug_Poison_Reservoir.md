Spend 1 AP to use Poison Reservoir to secrete poison onto your lips. The next person you kiss (skin contact is required) or with whom you share a drink must make a [[Basic](/../Keywords/Keyword_Basic)] Resilience or Threat roll with a DL of Moderate (14). Failure means they gain the [[Drugged](/../Conditions/Condition_Drugged)] condition.

Poison Reservoir naturally generates enough poison to be used once per scene. 

You are immune to the poison produced by your Poison Reservoir.

Poison Reservoir can be installed as a [[Mod](/../Keywords/Keyword_Mod)] in the [Cybernetic Lips](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Lips) augment.
