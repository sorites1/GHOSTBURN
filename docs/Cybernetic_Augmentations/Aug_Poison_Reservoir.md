# Poison Reservoir \[Augment\]

*Poison Reservoir is implanted in your lower lip, at the base of your gums. Using a bio-mechanical process, it naturally produces poison which can render an unsuspecting victim unconscious.*

Spend 1 AP to use Poison Reservoir to secrete poison onto your lips. The next person you kiss (skin contact is required) or with whom you share a drink must make a [[Basic](../Keywords/Keyword_Basic.md)] Resilience or Threat roll with a DL of Moderate (14). Failure means they gain the [[Drugged](../Conditions/Condition_Drugged.md)] condition.

Poison Reservoir naturally generates enough poison to be used once per scene. 

You are immune to the poison produced by your Poison Reservoir.

Poison Reservoir can be installed as a [[Mod](../Keywords/Keyword_Mod.md)] in the [Cybernetic Lips](../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Lips.md) augment.
