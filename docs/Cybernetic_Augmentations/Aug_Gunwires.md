# Gunwires

The \[Gunwires\] augment requires an inductive pad be installed in the your palm and wired up the arm to the brainstem. \[Gunwires\] only provides a benefit when you pair it with a [[Gunwire Grip](/../Weapon_Mods/Mods_Gunwire_Grip)] installed on a [[Firearm](/../Keywords/Keyword_Firearm)]. Together, \[Gunwires\] and the \[Gunwire Grip\] collect data from your weapon and vision to provide effective aim assistance.
