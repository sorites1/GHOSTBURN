Use a Darkline Node to wirelessly access the Dark Net. You can also use Darkline Node to convert a Data Bundle into an \[Encrypted Package\] with the same \[Security\] as the augment.

A Darkline Node monitors your other \[Wireless\] augments and provides an extra layer of \[Security\] against hackers. If a hacker gains \[Admin\] access to one of your \[Wireless\] augments, they must also gain \[Admin\] access to the Darkline Node before they can use [Cybernetic Hack](../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Hacking_Cybernetic_Hack.md).

Darkline Node includes \[Security\] based on its level. Darkline Node (Level 1): Easy (8), Darkline Node (Level 2): Moderate (14), Darkline Node (Level 3): Hard (20), Darkline Node (Level 4): Severe (26).
