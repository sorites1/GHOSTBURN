# Comms

The \[Comms\] augment is implanted behind either ear, at the base of the skull. It allows you to make and receive calls and to listen to other audio sources. If you have [[Cybernetic Eyes](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Eyes)] installed, \[Comms\] can be used for video calling and to watch other video sources. Accessing audio and video on the Net is a basic function, as is the ability to stream audio and video to and from other \[Comms\] users, with their consent. When speaking through \[Comms\], you may do so silently by forming the words with your tongue in your mouth (while keeping your lips closed).
