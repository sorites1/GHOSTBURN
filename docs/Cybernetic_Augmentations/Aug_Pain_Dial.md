# Pain Dial

The \[Pain Dial\] augment puts a literal, physical knob on your waistline, atop one of your pelvic bones. On your turn, spend 1 AP to set the \[Pain Dial\] to any of its three levels or to turn it off. At Level 1, you ignore the effects of being [[Wounded](/../Conditions/Condition_Wounded)]. At Level 2, you ignore the effects of [[Severely Wounded](/../Conditions/Condition_Severely_Wounded)]. At Level 3, you ignore the effects of [[Death's Door](/../Conditions/Condition_Deaths_Door)], except you must still roll to see if you sustain an injury. If you do sustain an injury and the [[Agony](/../Conditions/Condition_Agony)] condition would be applied, you ignore it. 

At the end of your turn, if \[Pain Dial\] is active, make a [[Basic](/../Keywords/Keyword_Basic)] Resilience roll with a DL based on the level it's set to: Easy (8) for Level 1, Moderate (14) for Level 2, and Hard (20) for Level 3. Failure means you suffer a pain overload, causing the \[Pain Dial\] to shutdown and any effects from \[Wounded\], \[Severely Wounded\], \[Death's Door\], and specific injuries immediately take effect.
