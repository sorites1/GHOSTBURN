Pain Dial has four positions: Off, 1, 2, and 3. Spend 1 AP to turn Pain Dial up or down by one position. For example, if Pain Dial is set to Off, spend 1 AP to turn Pain Dial to 1, spend another AP to turn Pain Dial to 2, and so on. The effects of each position is shown below.

|    1     | You ignore the effects of being [[Wounded](/../Conditions/Condition_Wounded)].                                                                                                                             |

At the start of your turn, if Pain Dial is active, make a [[Basic](/../Keywords/Keyword_Basic)] Resilience roll with a DL based on its current position: Easy (8) for Position 1, Moderate (14) for Position 2, and Hard (20) for Position 3. Failure means you suffer a pain overload, causing Pain Dial to shut down. Effects you were ignoring immediately take effect.
