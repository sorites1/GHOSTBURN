Spend 1 AP to use Voice Box to change your voice. You can replicate a specific voice with perfect accuracy, but first you need to spend 1 AP to listen to it, either live or as a recording. You can also mask your voice or apply effects to it, such as to make yourself sound raspy, garbled, robotic, etc. Last, you can use Voice Box to produce other, standard sound effects, such as the sound of a gunshot, laughter, a car alarm, and so on. The sound effects library included with Voice Box can be used to produce any reasonably common sound (GM discretion).

Voice Box can be installed as a [[Mod](../Keywords/Keyword_Mod.md)] in the [Cybernetic Larynx](../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Larynx.md) augment.
