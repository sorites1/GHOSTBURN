Cybernetic Eye (Base) is a replacement only. It performs all the functions of a natural eye. 

If you have two Cybernetic Eyes, they may be of different levels and each has its own Mod Slots.

You can activate or deactivate a [[Mod](/../Keywords/Keyword_Mod)] or switch to a different \[Mod\] installed in your Cybernetic Eye for free (0 AP). You gain the benefits of the active \[Mod\] until you deactivate it or switch to a different \[Mod\]. You may only have one \[Mod\] in your Cybernetic Eye active at a time. If you have two Cybernetic Eyes, the active Mod applies to both.

## Clearview Mod

You can install the Clearview Mod in a free Mod Slot in a Cybernetic Eye, as shown below. You may only install this \[Mod\] once. When \[Clearview\] is active, you ignore [[Concealment, Partial](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial)] that would normally be granted to targets because it is [[Raining](/../Conditions/Condition_Raining)] or [[Foggy](/../Conditions/Condition_Foggy)].

## Magnification Mod

You can install the Magnification Mod in a free Mod Slot in a Cybernetic Eye, as shown below. You may only install this \[Mod\] once. When \[Magnification\] is active, you can zoom in so you can see [[Far](/../Keywords/Keyword_Far)] away more easily. When used with the Firearms skill, \[Magnification\] acts as a [[Scope](/../Mod_Scope)] except it is not restricted to only Heavy Pistols and Rifles.

## Night Vision Mod

You can install the Night Vision Mod in a free Mod Slot in a Cybernetic Eye, as shown below. You may only install this \[Mod\] once. When \[Night Vision\] is active, you can see as well in the darkness as you can in the light. You ignore the effects of [[Dark](/../Conditions/Condition_Dark)]. However, when you are exposed to a bright light while using \[Night Vision], you are immediately [[Blinded](/../Conditions/Condition_Blinded)]. If you deactivate \[Night Vision\] or switch to a different \[Mod\, you lose \[Blinded\] at the end of your turn.

## Thermal Imaging Mod

You can install the Thermal Imaging Mod in a free Mod Slot in a Cybernetic Eye, as shown below. You may only install this \[Mod\] once. When \[Thermal Imaging\] is active, the world around you is [[Dark](/../Conditions/Condition_Dark)], but you can see patterns of heat visualized as bands of color (red, orange, yellow, green, and blue). People and animals, as well as machines that produce heat, like vehicles, can be easily detected with \[Thermal Imaging\]. This allows you to ignore a target's [[Concealment, Partial](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial)] or [[Concealment, Total](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Total)], unless the target is standing in front of another heat source, such that the two heat signatures would be indistinguishable from one another. \[Thermal Imaging\] can detect [[Nearby](/../Keywords/Keyword_Nearby)] heat through standard walls. However, when you are exposed to a bright light while using \[Thermal Imaging\], you are immediately [[Blinded](/../Conditions/Condition_Blinded)]. If you deactivate \[Thermal Imaging\] or switch to a different \[Mod\, you lose \[Blinded\] at the end of your turn.

## Video Recorder Mod

You can install the Video Recorder Mod in a free Mod Slot in a Cybernetic Eye, as shown below. You may only install this \[Mod\] once. When \[Video Recorder\] is active, you actively record what you see and hear. Recorded data is stored by the Video Recorder Mod, but it can also be redirected using [Comms](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Comms), [Datajack](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Datajack), or [Darkline Node](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Darkline_Node). such as to data storage on the Net or a live video stream service, as desired and based on your access to those resources.

## Awareness Mod

You can install an Awareness Mod in a free Mod Slot in a Cybernetic Eye to permanently raise your Awareness, as shown below. You may install this \[Mod\] multiple times, and its effects are cumulative. Each time you install a Awareness Mod, it uses one Mod Slot. 

|   Cost    | Mod                | Keywords                                                                               |

| 100,000 ⌆ | +1 Awareness (Aug) | [[Aug Increase](/../Keywords/Keyword_Aug_Increase)], [[Mod](/../Keywords/Keyword_Mod)] |

You should update your Piloting, Insight, and Perception skills to use your new Awareness score.
