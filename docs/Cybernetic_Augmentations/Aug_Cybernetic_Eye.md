# Cybernetic Eye

A \[Cybernetic Eye\] is an eye that comes in two varieties: cybernetically modified eye and replacement eye. 

* **Cybernetically Modified Eye** means the person retains their natural eye, but they are surgically altered to gain the benefits of augmentation. 
* **Replacement Eye** means the person has had their natural eye removed (or it might have been lost due to injury) and replaced with an obvious \[Cybernetic Eye\].

The only difference between these two types is the cost and appearance.

A \[Cybernetic Eye\] come in three levels: Cybernetic Eye 1, Cybernetic Eye 2, and Cybernetic Eye 3. Each level is an upgraded version of the prior level; they do not stack. Vision Mods must be purchased separately and installed using [[Cybernetic Installation](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Medicine_Cybernetic_Installation)]. When you purchase a \[Cybernetic Eye\], you can get a single eye or a set of two; there is no difference in cost, Mesh Cost, or capabilities.
