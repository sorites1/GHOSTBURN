# Skillset

The \[Skillset\] augment is attached to the spinal column and maps to several regions of the brain, including the Basal Ganglia and Hippocampus. You can interact with the \[Skillset\] augment by issuing voice commands, or if you have \[Cybernetic Eyes\], you can access a retinal user interface operated through eye movements. 

To use a \[Skillset\] augment, spend 1 AP and state the skill you want to download. In an millisecond, the skill rushes into your brain, filling you with knowledge and ability and granting you a bonus, as shown below. \[Skillset\] comes in three levels: \[Skillset 1\], \[Skillset 2\], and \[Skillset 3\]. These levels represent an upgrade path; they do not stack.

Once downloaded, a skill remains available until a new downloaded skill replaces it. A \[Skillset\] can only hold one skill at a time. This augment allows you to use the skill's [Core Tricks](/../Keywords/Keyword_Core_Trick) but not its [Signature Tricks](/../Keywords/Keyword_Signature_Trick).
