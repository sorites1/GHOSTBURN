# Skillset \[Augment\]

*Skillset firmly attaches to your spinal column and maps directly to your brain, so that when you download a new skill, the knowledge and ability can be directly infused into your body and mind.*

Spend 1 AP to activate Skillset and name the [Skill](/../Skills_and_Tricks/SaT_Skills_and_Tricks_List) you want to download. You gain an [[Aug Bonus](/../Keywords/Keyword_Aug_Bonus)] for the downloaded skill equal to the level of Skillset. Skillset (Level 1) grants a +1 \[Aug Bonus\]. Skillset (Level 2) grants a +2 \[Aug Bonus\]. Skillset (Level 3) grants a +3 \[Aug Bonus\].

Once downloaded, a skill and its \[Aug Bonus\] remain available until you download another one (which replaces the first). A \[Skillset\] can only hold one skill at a time. This augment does not grant access to a skill's [Signature Tricks](/../Keywords/Keyword_Signature_Trick).

Skillset wirelessly downloads Skill Paks from a licensed, megacorp Skills Management Service (SMS). If you have a [Darkline Node](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug__Darkline_Node) installed, you can download skills from a pirate SMS, such as one set up by a medium for their ghosts.
