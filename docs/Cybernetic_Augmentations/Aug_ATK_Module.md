# ATK Module

The \[ATK Module\] is an augment that works in conjunction with [[CAT Reflexes](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_CAT_Reflexes)] and [[Gunwires](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Gunwires)]. Both of these augments (at any level) must already be installed before the \[ATK Module\] can be implanted in the brain. ATK stands for Auto-Target-Kill. The \[ATK Module\] works by rapidly acquiring targets and queues up attacks against them so that when you [[Attack](/../Keywords/Keyword_Attack)] with a firearm that has a [[Gunwire Grip](/../Mod_Gunwire_Grip)], it is much easier to hit your target.
