# SLAP Gun \[Augment\]

*The SLAP (Spring-Loaded Auto-Pistol) Gun by Ranco is a hidden firearm compartment. With a gesture, a hatch in your forearm pops open, and a Ripper AP9 light pistol springs out and pushes into your open hand, ready to fire.*

Activating SLAP Gun is free (0 AP). Activation causes you to equip the [[Light Pistol](/../Keywords/Keyword_Light_Pistol)] hidden in your arm, and you may immediately use [Single Shot](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Firearms_Core_Single_Shot) or [Burst Fire](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Firearms_Core_Burst_Fire) at no additional AP cost. Stowing the weapon in its compartment costs 1 AP. 

SLAP Gun comes preloaded with a [Ranco Ripper AP9](/../Firearms/Firearms_LP_Ranco_Ripper_AP9), but any \[Light Pistol\] (which may contain its own mods) can be mounted in its compartment. It costs 1 AP to mount or unmount a \[Light Pistol\], a task which can be performed anywhere and without the need for special tools. 

SLAP Gun can be installed as a [[Mod](/../Keywords/Keyword_Mod)] in the [Cybernetic Arm](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Arm) augment.
