# Minidisk

The \[Minidisk\] augment works in conjunction with other augments capable of accessing data, like [[Comms](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Comms)], [[Video Recorder](/../Vision_Mods/Mods_Video_Recoder)], and [[Datajack](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Datajack)]. Data from any source you have access to can be downloaded onto your \[Minidisk\] and then ejected from the port (which can be located anywhere on your body, according to your preference). A \[Minidisk\] port is very small, but it is recognizable to those who know what it is. Once ejected, the data on your \[Minidisk\] is encrypted and air-gapped from the Net and your augments. You cannot use \[Minidisk\] again until you reinsert it or purchase a new one.
