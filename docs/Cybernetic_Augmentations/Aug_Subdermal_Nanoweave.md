# Subdermal Nanoweave

\[Subdermal Nanoweave\] is a fabric-like material comprised of tiny filaments that is implanted under the skin. This augmentation is unnoticeable except when a close-up inspection of the skin is performed, in which case a faint geometric pattern is visible, \[Subdermal Nanoweave\] counts as Nanoweave Armor. \[Subdermal Nanoweave\] and [[Dermal Armor](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Dermal_Armor)] are [[Incompatible](/../Keywords/Keyword_Incompatible)].
