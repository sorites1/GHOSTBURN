# Datavault \[Augment\]

*Datavault, used almost exclusively by data couriers, is a data storage augment that puts Encrypted Packages in hidden partitions so they are not accessible to anyone, even you.*

Transferring an [[Encrypted Package](../Keywords/Keyword_Encrypted_Package.md)] into your \[Datavault\] relies upon another one of your augments to act as a source of the data. For example, to download an \[Encrypted Package\] from the Net and put it on your \[Datavault\], you could use your [Datajack](../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Datajack.md). You could also transfer an \[Encrypted Package\] to your \[Datavault\] from a cartridge in your [Minidisk Port](../Aug_Minidisk_Port.md). You cannot transfer a regular Data Bundle into a Datavault; it must be converted into an \[Encrypted Package\] first. Augments like Datajack, Darkline Node, and Minidisk Port, are capable of performing this conversion. 

Transferring an \[Encrypted Package\] into a Datavault requires something called a Claim Check. A Claim Check is a digital code with two parts. The party who will claim delivery of the \[Encrypted Package\] in question generates the code. One part is given to the courier, and the other part is retained. When the courier transfers the \[Encrypted Package\] into their Datavault, they use the first part of the Claim Check to initiate a process known as *tornado fragging*, in which the \[Encrypted Package\] is intentionally fragmented and strewn across a series of hidden partitions. Later, when the courier delivers the \[Encrypted Package\], the other party provides the second part of the Claim Check code, which the courier uses to recover the \[Encrypted Package\] from the Datavault. Transferring an \[Encrypted Package\] out of a Datavault automatically deletes any local copies. 

A Datavault's tornado fragging process provides [[Security](../Keywords/Keyword_Security.md)] to any \[Encrypted Package\] stored within (in addition to the \[Security\] of the \[Encrypted Package\] itself). The \[Security\] of a Datavault is based on its level. Datavault (Level 1): Easy (8), Datavault (Level 2): Moderate (14), Datavault (Level 3): Hard (20), Datavault (Level 4): Severe (26).
