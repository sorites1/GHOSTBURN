# Night Vision

\[Night Vision\] is a quality that can be applied to goggles, helmets (with visor), video cameras, and [[Cybernetic Eyes](/../Aug_Cybernetic_Eye)]. When \[Night Vision\] is active, you can see as well in the darkness as you can in the light. You ignore the effects of [[Dark](/../Conditions/Condition_Dark)].

When you are exposed to a bright light while using \[Night Vision], you are immediately [[Blinded](/../Conditions/Condition_Blinded)]. If you disable \[Night Vision\], you lose \[Blinded\] at the end of your turn.
