There are fifteen skills in this game, three for each of the core five [abilities](/../Characters/Char_Abilities_and_Ability_Scores) (Presence, Awareness, Agility, Intelligence, and Strength). For example, the three skills associated with Agility are Drive, Firearms, and Stealth.

If your character knows a skill, it will have a [skill bonus](/../Keywords/Keyword_Skill_Bonus) ranging from +1 to +3. When you [make a roll](/../PtG_Making_a_Roll) with a skill, you add your skill bonus and the skill's primary ability score to the roll. 

The skills in this game include rules for [tricks](/../Keywords/Keyword_Trick), which are specific uses of a skill. For example, the Medicine skill includes a trick called First Aid and another called Surgery.

Tricks are categorized as being either [core tricks](/../Keywords/Keyword_Core_Trick) or [signature tricks](/../Keywords/Keyword_Signature_Trick). Anyone may use core tricks, even if they have no skill bonus, but you can only use a signature trick if your character knows it.

When a player wants to try something not covered by the rules, the GM can allow them to perform an [improvised trick](/../Keywords/Keyword_Improvised_Trick).

Refer to the [Skills and Tricks List](/../Skills_and_Tricks/SaT_Skills_and_Tricks_List) for a full list of skills and tricks included in this game.
