There are fifteen skills in this game, three for each of the core five [abilities](../Characters/Character_Creation/Abilities_and_Ability_Scores.md) (Presence, Awareness, Agility, Intelligence, and Strength). For example, the three skills associated with Agility are Drive, Firearms, and Stealth.

If your character knows a skill, it will have a [skill bonus](../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Skill_Bonus.md) ranging from +1 to +3. When you [make a roll](../Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Making_a_Roll.md) with a skill, you add your skill bonus and the skill's primary ability score to the roll. 

The skills in this game include rules for [tricks](../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Trick.md), which are specific uses of a skill. For example, the Medicine skill includes a trick called First Aid and another called Surgery.

Tricks are categorized as being either [core tricks](../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Core_Trick.md) or [signature tricks](../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Signature_Trick.md). Anyone may use core tricks, even if they have no skill bonus, but you can only use a signature trick if your character knows it.

When a player wants to try something not covered by the rules, the GM can allow them to perform an [improvised trick](../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Improvised_Trick.md).

Refer to the [Skills and Tricks List](../Skills_and_Tricks/All_Skills.md) for a full list of skills and tricks included in this game.
