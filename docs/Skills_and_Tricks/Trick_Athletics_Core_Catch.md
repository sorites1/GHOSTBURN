| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill     | Keywords                                           |
| --------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Moderate (14)         | Athletics | [[Two Hands](../Keywords/Keyword_Two_Hands\.md)], [[Physical](../Keywords/Keyword_Physical\.md)], [[Range](../Keywords/Keyword_Range\.md)], [[Visual](../Keywords/Keyword_Visual\.md)] |

*You catch an object as it's falling or that was thrown to you.* 

When an object is thrown to you or falls [[Close](../Keywords/Keyword_Close.md)] to you, you can use a [[Reaction](../Keywords/Keyword_Reaction.md)] to Catch it. If you use only [[One Hand](../Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand.md)], raise the DL by one. If the object is difficult to catch due to its size, weight, or other factors, the GM may raise the DL by one or simply state that it is not possible.
