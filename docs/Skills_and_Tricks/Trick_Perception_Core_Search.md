# Search \[Core Trick\]

| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill      | Keywords                           |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Hard (20)             | Perception | [[Move](/../Keywords/Keyword_Move)], [[Physical](/../Keywords/Keyword_Physical)], [[Visual](/../Keywords/Keyword_Visual)] |

*You move about and study your surroundings for hidden people or objects.* 

When you use Search, define the scope of your search to the GM, such as *I want to search the desk*, *I want to see if anyone has a weapon,* or *I want to scan the rooftops for people*. If you physically interact with the subject of your search, lower the DL by one. For example, if you're looking for weapons on someone, and you include a physical pat-down as part of your Search, the DL is lowered by one.
