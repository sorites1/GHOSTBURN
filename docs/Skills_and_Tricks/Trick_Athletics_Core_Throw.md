*You throw an object and hit your mark.* 

To use Throw, identify the mark, the spot where you want the object to land or the person you are throwing to. If the mark is [[Far](../Keywords/Keyword_Far.md)] away, raise the DL by one. If the object cannot be thrown effectively due to its weight, size, or other factors. the GM may raise the DL by one, tell the player they can only throw the object [[Close](../Keywords/Keyword_Close.md)] or [[Nearby](../Keywords/Keyword_Nearby.md)], or simply state that it is not possible.
