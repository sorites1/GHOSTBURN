When you use Full Auto, your target must be at the [[Optimal Range](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Optimal_Range.md)] for your weapon. If they are at a different range, raise the DL by one. You may use [[Spray](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Spray.md)] to hit up to four additional targets (five total). Use your weapon's Full Auto [[Damage Array](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Damage_Array.md)] with this trick.
