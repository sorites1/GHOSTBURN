*You are plugged in to the corporate world of cutthroat business.* 

When you use Corporate Culture, you ask the GM a question related to corporations, what they provide, business processes, c-suite execs, scandals, lawsuits, etc. For example, you might ask, *What do I know about Knifepoint Capital?* or *What corporations have a beef with Knifepoint Capital?*
