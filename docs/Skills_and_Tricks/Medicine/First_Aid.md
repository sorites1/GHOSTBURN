| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill    | Keywords                                                               |

| Stabilization DL      | Medicine | [[Concentrate](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Concentrate.md)], [[Physical](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Physical.md)], [[Supplies](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Supplies.md)], [[Two Hands](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Two_Hands.md)], [[Visual](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Visual.md)] |

*When a friend falls in combat or suffers from another treatable condition, you rush to their side and use your medical knowledge to stabilize them.*

If you use First Aid without [[Supplies](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Supplies.md)] raise the DL by one.
