*You are well aware of the equipment, tactics, and methods employed by milsec personnel.* 

When you use Milsec Culture, you ask the GM a question related to military and security organizations, weapons, tactics, teamwork, security, crowd control, and black ops. For example, you might ask, *What's a typical response for this corp's security guards? Are they going to shoot first and ask questions later?* *Are these guards well trained or just scrubs with guns?*
