*You know this city like the back of your hand.* 

When you use City Culture, you ask the GM a question related to the city you're in. For example, discovering a clue may lead you to ask, *What do I know about the PRISM nightclub?* or *What is the '12th Annual Rose Festival' that we read about? Have I ever heard of that before?* The scope of this trick is limited to information about the city and its inhabitants.
