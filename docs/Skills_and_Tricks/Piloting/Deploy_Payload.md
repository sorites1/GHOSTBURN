*Having piloted your drone to its destination, you carefully position it and deploy its payload.*

To use Deploy Payload, describe the spot [[Nearby](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Nearby.md)] where you want to drop your payload. This spot is called *the mark*. For example, *I want to place the package in front of the door*, or *I want to drop the grenade on the truck*. If the mark is in a spot that is hard to navigate, the the GM should raise the DL by one. If the mark is extremely hard to navigate, raise the DL by two.
