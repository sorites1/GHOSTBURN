| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill    | Keywords                                                       |

| Wits                  | Persuade | \[Attitude\], [[Physical](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Physical.md)], [[Range](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Range.md)], [[Social](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Social.md)], [[Visible](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Visible.md)] |

*With a simple change in posture, a strut in your step, or a flick of your hair, you can put on "the look" that makes everyone sit up and take notice.* 

To use this trick, the opponent(s) must be [[Close](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Close.md)] or [[Nearby](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Nearby.md)]. If there are multiple onlookers, use the highest Wits amongst the [[Group](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Group.md)].
