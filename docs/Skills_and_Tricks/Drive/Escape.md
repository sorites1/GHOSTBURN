| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill | Keywords                                                                     |

| Hard (20)             | Drive | [[Move](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Move.md)], [[Physical](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Physical.md)], [[Reaction](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Reaction.md)], [[Two Hands](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Two_Hands.md)], [[Vehicle](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle.md)], [[Visual](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Visual.md)] |

*When your opponent falls behind, you seize the opportunity and drive your car out of sight to lose them completely.* 

When you are driving a [[Vehicle](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle.md)] that's the target of a Chase and your opponent falls behind, you may use a [[Reaction](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Reaction.md)] to Escape. The [[Handling](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Handling.md)] of your \[Vehicle\] applies to the DL of your Escape roll. If you use only [[One Hand](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand.md)], raise the DL by one.
