| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill | Keywords                                                                  |

| Hard (20)             | Drive | [[Move](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Move.md)], [[Physical](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Physical.md)], [[Range](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Range.md)], [[Two Hands](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Two_Hands.md)], [[Vehicle](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle.md)], [[Visual](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Visual.md)] |

*You spot the car you're chasing up ahead and rapidly accelerate to catch up.* 

When you use Chase, you identify a target [[Vehicle](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle.md)] ahead of you ([[Nearby](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Nearby.md)] or [[Far](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Far.md)]). If the other \[Vehicle\] is traveling at [[High Speed](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_High_Speed.md)], you must do the same (which raises the DL by one). If the other \[Vehicle\] is \[Far\] away, raise the DL by one. The [[Handling](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Handling.md)] of your \[Vehicle\] applies to the DL of your Chase roll. If you use only [[One Hand](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand.md)], raise the DL by one.
