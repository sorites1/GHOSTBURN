| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill | Keywords                                             |
| --------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Hard (20)             | Drive | [[Physical](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Physical.md)], [[Two Hands](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Two_Hands.md)], [[Vehicle](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle.md)], [[Visual](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Visual.md)] |

*When you're behind the wheel, you are capable of pulling off daring high-speed stunts that threaten to break the laws of physics.* 

To use this trick, you must be driving a [[Vehicle](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle.md)] at [[High Speed](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_High_Speed.md)] (but this does not raise the DL as it normally would). When you use Driving Stunt, state your desired outcome, such as *I want to jump the draw bridge while it's opening* or *I want to tilt my car so it's almost on its side and I can go through a narrow alley.* If you only use [[One Hand](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand.md)] with Driving Stunt, raise the DL by one.

| Cool Success | You get the desired outcome and you are [[Lucky](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Lucky.md)]                                       |
| Success      | You get the desired outcome                                                                                         |
| Fade         | You get the desired outcome but your \[Vehicle\] takes 5 damage                                                     |
| Glitch       | You lose control of your [[Vehicle](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle.md)] and it [[Crashes](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Crashes.md)] |
