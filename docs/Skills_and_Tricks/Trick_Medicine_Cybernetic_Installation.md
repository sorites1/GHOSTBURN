*Surgery might be more glamorous, but knowing how to install cyberware saves just about as many lives in the sprawl.* 

You cannot use Cybernetic Installation on someone who is \[[[Condition_Bleeding|Bleeding]]\], \[[[Condition_Traumatized|Traumatized]]\], or in \[[[Condition_Critical_Condition|Critical Condition]]\]. The patient must be \[[[Condition_Stabilized|Stabilized]]\] with First Aid to remove those conditions before Cybernetic Installation can be performed. You may install multiple pieces of cyberware on the same target during the same \[[[Keyword_Surgical_Procedure|Surgical Procedure]]\], but you must roll separately for each one. It does not matter the order you install them in. You cannot use this trick on yourself.
