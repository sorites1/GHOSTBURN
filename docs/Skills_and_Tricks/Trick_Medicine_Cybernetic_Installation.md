*Surgery might be more glamorous, but knowing how to install cyberware saves just about as many lives in the sprawl.* 

You cannot use Cybernetic Installation on someone who is [[Bleeding](../Conditions/Condition_Bleeding.md)], [[Traumatized](../Conditions/Condition_Traumatized.md)], or in [[Critical Condition](../Conditions/Condition_Critical_Condition.md)]. The patient must be [[Stabilized](../Conditions/Condition_Stabilized.md)] with First Aid to remove those conditions before Cybernetic Installation can be performed. You may install multiple pieces of cyberware on the same target during the same [[Surgical Procedure](../Keywords/Keyword_Surgical_Procedure.md)], but you must roll separately for each one. It does not matter the order you install them in. You cannot use this trick on yourself.
