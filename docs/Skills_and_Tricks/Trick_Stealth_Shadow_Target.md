*To be an effective tail, you must leave enough distance between yourself and the target, or else you risk being noticed. At the same time, you must stay close enough that you can keep them in your sights.* 

To use Shadow Target you must be \[[[Condition_Undetected|Undetected]]\] by the person you are following. The scope of Shadow Target includes the distance from one \[[[Keyword_Location|Location]]\] to another. Every new destination along the target's route requires another Stealth roll. You may use Shadow Target with any mode of transport, such as on foot, bicycle, or vehicle.
