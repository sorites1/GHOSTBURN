| Hard (20)             | Drive | [[Move](/../Keywords/Keyword_Move)], [[Physical](/../Keywords/Keyword_Physical)], [[Reaction](/../Keywords/Keyword_Reaction)], [[Two Hands](/../Keywords/Keyword_Two_Hands)], [[Vehicle](/../Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle)], [[Visual](/../Keywords/Keyword_Visual)] |

*When your opponent falls behind, you seize the opportunity and drive your car out of sight to lose them completely.* 

When you are driving a [[Vehicle](/../Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle)] that's the target of a Chase and your opponent falls behind, you may use a [[Reaction](/../Keywords/Keyword_Reaction)] to Escape. The [[Handling](/../Keywords/Keyword_Handling)] of your \[Vehicle\] applies to the DL of your Lose Them roll. If you use only [[One Hand](/../Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand)], raise the DL by one.
