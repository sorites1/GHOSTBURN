| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill | Keywords                                             |

| Hard (20)             | Drive | [[Physical](../Keywords/Keyword_Physical\.md)], [[Two Hands](../Keywords/Keyword_Two_Hands\.md)], [[Vehicle](../Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle\.md)], [[Visual](../Keywords/Keyword_Visual\.md)] |

*When you're behind the wheel, you are capable of pulling off daring high-speed stunts that threaten to break the laws of physics.* 

To use this trick, you must be driving a [[Vehicle](../Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle.md)] at [[High Speed](../Keywords/Keyword_High_Speed.md)] (but this does not raise the DL as it normally would). When you use Driving Stunt, state your desired outcome, such as *I want to jump the draw bridge while it's opening* or *I want to tilt my car so it's almost on its side and I can go through a narrow alley.* If you only use [[One Hand](../Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand.md)] with Driving Stunt, raise the DL by one.

| Cool Success | You get the desired outcome and you are [[Lucky](../Keywords/Keyword_Lucky\.md)]                                       |
| Success      | You get the desired outcome                                                                                         |
| Fade         | You get the desired outcome but your \[Vehicle\] takes 5 damage                                                     |
| Glitch       | You lose control of your [[Vehicle](../Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle\.md)] and it [[Crashes](../Keywords/Keyword_Crashes\.md)] |
