| Difficulty Level (DL) | Skill | Keywords                                             |

| Hard (20)             | Drive | [[Physical](/../Keywords/Keyword_Physical)], [[Two Hands](/../Keywords/Keyword_Two_Hands)], [[Vehicle](/../Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle)], [[Visual](/../Keywords/Keyword_Visual)] |

*When you're behind the wheel, you are capable of pulling off daring high-speed stunts that threaten to break the laws of physics.* 

To use this trick, you must be driving a [[Vehicle](/../Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle)] at [[High Speed](/../Keywords/Keyword_High_Speed)] (but this does not raise the DL as it normally would). When you use Driving Stunt, state your desired outcome, such as *I want to jump the draw bridge while it's opening* or *I want to tilt my car so it's almost on its side and I can go through a narrow alley.* If you only use [[One Hand](/../Keywords/Keyword_One_Hand)] with Driving Stunt, raise the DL by one.

| Fade         | You get the desired outcome but your \[Vehicle\] takes 5 damage                                                     |
| Glitch       | You lose control of your [[Vehicle](/../Keywords/Keyword_Vehicle)] and it [[Crashes](/../Keywords/Keyword_Crashes)] |
