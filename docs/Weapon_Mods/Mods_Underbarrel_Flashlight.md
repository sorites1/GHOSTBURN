# Underbarrel Flashlight

An \[Underbarrel Flashlight\] is built into or attached to a firearm. When turned on, an \[Underbarrel Flashlight\] illuminates everything [[Nearby](/../Keywords/Keyword_Nearby)] with a bright, white light, which eliminates the [[Dark](/../Conditions/Condition_Dark)] condition from that area. Additionally, anyone in the illuminated area has difficulty seeing you, as the bright light obscures their vision. You have [[Concealment, Partial](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial)] against them.
