# Laser Sight

A \[Laser Sight\] is built into or attached to a firearm. When turned on, a \[Laser Sight\] creates a thin, barely visible beam of light that puts a colored dot (usually red or green) on the target, making it easier to hit. You gain a +1 [[Gear Bonus](/../Keywords/Keyword_Gear_Bonus)] to Firearms when using a \[Laser Sight\].
