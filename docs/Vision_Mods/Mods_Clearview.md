# Clearview

\[Clearview\] is a quality that can be applied to goggles, helmets (with visor), video cameras, and cybernetic eyes. When \[Clearview\] is active, you ignore [[Concealment, Partial](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial)] that would normally be granted to targets because it is [[Raining](/../Conditions/Condition_Raining)] or [[Foggy](/../Conditions/Condition_Foggy)].
