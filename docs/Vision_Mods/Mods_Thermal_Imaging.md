# Thermal Imaging

\[Thermal Imaging\] is a quality that can be applied to handheld devices, goggles, helmets (with visor), video cameras, and [[Cybernetic Eyes](/../Cybernetic_Augmentations/Aug_Cybernetic_Eyes)]. When \[Thermal Imaging\] is active, the world around you is [[Dark](/../Conditions/Condition_Dark)], but you can see patterns of heat visualized as bands of color (red, orange, yellow, green, and blue). 

People and animals, as well as machines that produce heat, like vehicles, can be easily detected with \[Thermal Imaging\]. This allows you to ignore a target's [[Concealment, Partial](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial)] or [[Concealment, Total](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Total)], unless the target is standing in front of another heat source, such that the two heat signatures would be indistinguishable from one another. \[Thermal Imaging\] can detect [[Nearby](/../Keywords/Keyword_Nearby)] heat through standard walls.

When you are exposed to a bright light while using \[Thermal Imaging], you are immediately [[Blinded](/../Conditions/Condition_Blinded)]. If you disable \[Thermal Imaging\], you lose \[Blinded\] at the end of your turn.
