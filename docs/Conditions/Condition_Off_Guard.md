# Off Guard

**Cause:** When you are in a state of being unprepared for danger, you are \[Off Guard\]. Most people are \[Off Guard\] by default.

**Effect:** An [[Attack](/../Keywords/Keyword_Attack)] made against you has its DL lowered by one. 

**Removal:** When you observe immediate danger or are alerted to its presence, you lose the \[Off Guard\] condition.
