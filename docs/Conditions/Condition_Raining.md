# Raining

**Cause:** When a steady rainfall makes it difficult to see and hear, it is \[Raining\].

**Effect:** Targets in an area where it is \[Raining\] have [[Concealment, Partial](../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial.md)]. Tricks with the [[Vocal](../Keywords/Keyword_Vocal.md)] keyword have their DL raised by one.

**Removal:** When rainfall thins or stops in an area, it loses \[Raining\].
