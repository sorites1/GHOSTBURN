**Cause:** When you are the target of a successful First Aid roll, or you succeed on a basic Resilience roll to avoid Dying, you gain the \[Stabilized\] condition.. 

**Effect:** You gain 1 HP and lose the following conditions: [[Bleeding](../Conditions/Condition_Bleeding.md)], [[Critical Condition](../Conditions/Condition_Critical_Condition.md)], [[Dying](../Conditions/Condition_Dying.md)], [[Traumatized](../Conditions/Condition_Traumatized.md)], and [[Unconscious](../Conditions/Condition_Unconscious.md)].

**Removal:** After \[Stabilized\] takes effect on you, you lose the \[Stabilized\] condition.
