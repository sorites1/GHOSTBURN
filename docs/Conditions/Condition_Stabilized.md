# Stabilized

**Cause:** When you are the target of a successful First Aid roll, or you succeed on a basic Resilience roll to avoid Dying, you gain the \[Stabilized\] condition.. 

**Effect:** You gain 1 HP and lose the following conditions: [[Bleeding](/../Conditions/Condition_Bleeding)], [[Critical Condition](/../Conditions/Condition_Critical_Condition)], [[Dying](/../Conditions/Condition_Dying)], [[Traumatized](/../Conditions/Condition_Traumatized)], and [[Unconscious](/../Conditions/Condition_Unconscious)].

**Removal:** After \[Stabilized\] takes effect on you, you lose the \[Stabilized\] condition.
