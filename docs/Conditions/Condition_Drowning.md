## Drowning

**Cause:** When you are underwater and unable to breathe or hold your breathe, you are \[Drowning\]. If you are swimming and become \[[[Condition_Unconscious|Unconscious]]\], you automatically begin \[Drowning\]. If you are forced to go \[[[Condition_Prone|Prone]]\] while swimming, you begin \[Drowning\].

**Effect:** You lose \[Prone\] and gain \[[[Condition_Movement_Restricted|Movement Restricted]]\] and \[[[Condition_Off_Guard|Off Guard]]\]. All skills and tricks have their DL raised by one. At the start of your turn, take 5 damage and make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Severe (18). If you succeed, you automatically \[[[Keyword_Move|Move]]\] \[[[Keyword_Nearby|Nearby]]\] towards the water's surface. If the water's surface was \[[[Keyword_Far|Far]]\] away, you are still \[Drowning\]. Otherwise, you break the water's surface.

**Removal:** If you break the water's surface, you lose \[Drowning\].
