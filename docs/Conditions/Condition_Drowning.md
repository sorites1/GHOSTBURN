# Drowning

**Cause:** When you are underwater and unable to breathe or hold your breathe, you are \[Drowning\]. If you are swimming and become [[Unconscious](/../Conditions/Condition_Unconscious)], you automatically begin \[Drowning\]. If you are forced to go [[Prone](/../Conditions/Condition_Prone)] while swimming, you begin \[Drowning\].

**Effect:** You lose \[Prone\] and gain [[Movement Restricted](/../Conditions/Condition_Movement_Restricted)] and [[Off Guard](/../Conditions/Condition_Off_Guard)]. All skills and tricks have their DL raised by one. At the start of your turn, take 5 damage and make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Severe (18). If you succeed, you automatically [[Move](/../Keywords/Keyword_Move)] [[Nearby](/../Keywords/Keyword_Nearby)] towards the water's surface. If the water's surface was [[Far](/../Keywords/Keyword_Far)] away, you are still \[Drowning\]. Otherwise, you break the water's surface.

**Removal:** If you break the water's surface, you lose \[Drowning\].
