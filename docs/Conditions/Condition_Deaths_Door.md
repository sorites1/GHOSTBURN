# Death's Door

**Cause:** When you are reduced to half your Severely Wounded value (or less) in hit points, you gain the \[Death's Door\] condition. This condition follows and replaces [[Wounded](../Conditions/Condition_Wounded.md)] and [[Severely Wounded](../Conditions/Condition_Severely_Wounded.md)].

**Effect:** You gain [[Movement Restricted](../Conditions/Condition_Movement_Restricted.md)]. You are [[Prone](../Conditions/Condition_Prone.md)]. All skill actions have their DL raised by one. The first time you gain \[Death's Door\] during a scene, roll on the Injury Level Chart; see [[Sustaining an Injury](../Health_and_Healing/HaH_Sustaining_an_Injury.md)].

**Removal:** When you have more than half of your Severely Wounded hit points, you lose the \[Death's Door\] condition. You also lose the \[Death's Door\] condition if you advance to [[Dying](../Conditions/Condition_Dying.md)].
