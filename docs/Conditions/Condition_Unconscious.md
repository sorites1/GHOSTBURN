# Unconscious

**Cause:** When you gain the [[Dying](/../Conditions/Condition_Dying)] condition, you also gain \[Unconscious\]. You can also be rendered \[Unconscious\] by certain tricks or conditions.

**Effect:** You are [[Immobilized](/../Conditions/Condition_Immobilized)], [[Incapable](/../Conditions/Condition_Incapable)], [[Prone](/../Conditions/Condition_Prone)], [[Unaware](/../Conditions/Condition_Unaware)], and [[Unresponsive](/../Conditions/Condition_Unresponsive)].

**Removal:** If you are \[Dying\], you must be [[Stabilized](/../Conditions/Condition_Stabilized)] with at least 1 hp to lose the \[Unconscious\] condition. If another condition or effect caused you to become \[Unconscious\], and it has its own Removal, you must abide by it. If no other Removal is indicated, then at the start of your turn, make a [[Basic](/../Keywords/Keyword_Basic)] Resilience or Threat roll with a DL of Easy (8). Success means you lose the \[Unconscious\] condition.
