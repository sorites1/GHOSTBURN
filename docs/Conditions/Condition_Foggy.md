# Foggy

**Cause:** When a lingering haze fills the air, obscuring people and objects in the distance, it is \[Foggy\].

**Effect:** Without some kind of imaging enhancement like [[Clearview](/../Mods_Clearview)], it is impossible to identify targets at [[Far](/../Keywords/Keyword_Far)] range (or beyond \[Far\] with a [[Scope](/../Mods_Scope)]) when it is \[Foggy\]. Targets who are [[Nearby](/../Keywords/Keyword_Nearby)] have [[Concealment, Partial](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial)]. Targets who are [[Close](/../Keywords/Keyword_Close)] are unaffected.

**Removal:** When the fog thins or dissipates in an area, it loses \[Foggy\].
