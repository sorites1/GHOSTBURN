# Dying

**Cause:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you gain the \[Dying\] condition. This condition follows and replaces [[Healthy](../Conditions/Condition_Healthy.md)], [[Wounded](../Conditions/Condition_Wounded.md)], [[Severely Wounded](../Conditions/Condition_Severely_Wounded.md)], and \[Death's Door\].

**Effect:** You are [[Unconscious](../Conditions/Condition_Unconscious.md)]. Make a mark. At the start of your turn, make a basic Resilience roll with a DL of Hard (14). Success means you gain the [[Stabilized](../Conditions/Condition_Stabilized.md)] condition. Failure means you make another mark. If you accumulate more marks than your Resilience score, you are dead.

**Removal:** When you gain \[Stabilized\], you lose the \[Dying\] condition. You have 1 hit point.
