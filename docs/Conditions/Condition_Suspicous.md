# Suspicious

**Cause:** When you sense that someone may be lying, hiding something, or mispresenting the truth, you are \[Suspicious\]. This condition cannot be applied to player characters.

**Effect:** If you have a [[Friendly](/../Keywords/Keyword_Friendly)] [[Attitude](/../Keywords/Keyword_Attitude)] it worsens to [[Neutral](/../Keywords/Keyword_Neutral)]. [[Social](/../Keywords/Keyword_Social)] skills and tricks used against you have their DL raised by one. If the person you are \[Suspicious\] of is using a [Disguise](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Deception_Disguise) or a [Forgery](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Deception_Forgery), you may attempt to see through it. To see through a Disguise or Forgery, the GM makes a [Threat](/../Keywords/Keyword_Threat) roll for the NPC and uses the DL set by the outcome the player achieved on their Disguise or Forgery roll.

**Removal:** If the subject of your suspicions improves your \[Attitude\] to \[Friendly\], you lose \[Suspicious\].
