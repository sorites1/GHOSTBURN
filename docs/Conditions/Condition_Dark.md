# Dark

**Cause:** When an area lacks sufficient illumination, making it very hard to see, it is \[Dark\].

**Effect:** When you are in the \[Dark\], you gain [[Movement Impaired](/../Conditions/Condition_Movement_Impaired)]. Also, targets at [[Close](/../Keywords/Keyword_Close)] range have [[Concealment, Partial](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial)], and targets who are [[Nearby](/../Keywords/Keyword_Nearby)] or farther away in the \[Dark\] have [[Concealment, Total](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Total)]. 

**Removal:** When an area is illuminated, it loses \[Dark\].
