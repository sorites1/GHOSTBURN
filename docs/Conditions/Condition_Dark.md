# Dark

**Cause:** When an area lacks sufficient illumination, making it very hard to see, it is \[Dark\].

**Effect:** When you are in the \[Dark\], you gain [[Movement Impaired](../Conditions/Condition_Movement_Impaired.md)]. Also, targets at [[Close](../Keywords/Keyword_Close.md)] range have [[Concealment, Partial](../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Partial.md)], and targets who are [[Nearby](../Keywords/Keyword_Nearby.md)] or farther away in the \[Dark\] have [[Concealment, Total](../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Total.md)]. 

**Removal:** When an area is illuminated, it loses \[Dark\].
