## Cover, Full

**Cause:** Your body is fully behind a solid object, and you are in now way exposed, making it impossible to see you or make an \[[[Keyword_Attack|Attack]]\] against you. It is possible to have \[Cover, Full\] to one observer and not another.

**Effect:** Attacks made against you by an observer to whom you have \[Cover, Full\] automatically fail.

**Removal:** When you become fully exposed to an observer or gain \[[[Condition_Cover_Partial|Cover, Partial]]\] to them, you no longer have \[Cover, Full\] to them.
