# Deafened

**Cause:** When a skill, trick, or condition prevents you from hearing, you gain the \[Deafened\] condition. This condition replaces \[Hearing Impaired\].

**Effect:** You cannot hear. You are immune to sound-based attacks. Skill and tricks with the [[Vocal](/../Keywords/Keyword_Vocal)] keyword have their DL raised by one. You are unable to use skills or tricks that have the [[Auditory](/../Keywords/Keyword_Auditory)] keyword.

**Removal:** When the effect or condition that caused you to be \[Deafened\] is removed, you lose the \[Deafened\] condition. In rare cases, this condition is permanent.
