# Bewildered

**Cause:** When a skill action, condition, or effect leaves you deeply and utterly confused, you are \[Bewildered\]. This counts as and replaces the [[Distracted](/../Conditions/Condition_Distracted)] condition.

**Effect:** Tricks used on you have their DL lowered by one and their outcomes are [[Upgraded](/../Keywords/Keyword_Upgraded)].

**Removal:** At the start of your turn, you lose the \[Bewildered\] condition.
