# Severely Wounded

**Cause:** When you are reduced to half your half of your [[Wounded](../Conditions/Condition_Wounded.md)] value (or less) in hit points, you gain the \[Severely Wounded\] condition.

**Effect:** You gain [[Movement Impaired](../Conditions/Condition_Movement_Impaired.md)]. All skill actions have their DL raised by one.

**Removal:** When you have more than half your \[Wounded\] value in hit points, you lose the \[Severely Wounded\] condition. You also lose the \[Severely Wounded\] condition if you advance to [[Death's Door](../Conditions/Condition_Deaths_Door.md)] or [[Dying](../Conditions/Condition_Dying.md)].
