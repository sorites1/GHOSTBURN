# Blinded

**Cause:** When an attack, condition, or environmental effect prevents you from seeing, you are \[Blinded\]. This condition replaces [[Vision Impairment](../Conditions/Condition_Vision_Impairment.md)].

**Effect:** You cannot see. All targets have [[Concealment, Total](../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Total.md)] from you. Tricks with the [[Visual](../Keywords/Keyword_Visual.md)] keyword have their DL raised by one and their outcomes [[Downgraded](../Keywords/Keyword_Downgraded.md)]. It is not possible to even attempt an action that is exclusively dependent upon sight, such as identifying the man in the bowler hat. You gain [[Movement Restricted](../Conditions/Condition_Movement_Restricted.md)]. 

**Removal:** When the condition or environmental effect that caused you to be \[Blinded\] is removed, you lose the \[Blinded\] condition. In rare cases, this condition is permanent.
