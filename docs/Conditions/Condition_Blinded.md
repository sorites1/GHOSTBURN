# Blinded

**Cause:** When an attack, condition, or environmental effect prevents you from seeing, you are \[Blinded\]. This condition replaces [[Vision Impairment](/../Conditions/Condition_Vision_Impairment)].

**Effect:** You cannot see. All targets have [[Concealment, Total](/../Conditions/Condition_Concealment_Total)] from you. Tricks with the [[Visual](/../Keywords/Keyword_Visual)] keyword have their DL raised by one and their outcomes [[Downgraded](/../Keywords/Keyword_Downgraded)]. It is not possible to even attempt an action that is exclusively dependent upon sight, such as identifying the man in the bowler hat. You gain [[Movement Restricted](/../Conditions/Condition_Movement_Restricted)]. 

**Removal:** When the condition or environmental effect that caused you to be \[Blinded\] is removed, you lose the \[Blinded\] condition. In rare cases, this condition is permanent.
