## Jammed

**Cause:** When a trick or condition uses electronic interference to temporarily prevent a device from functioning properly, it is \[Jammed\]. 

**Effect:** The device does not function while it is \[Jammed\]. If the device was moving of its own accord, it stops. If it was flying, it lands safely on the first available surface and stops. If you are remotely controlling when it becomes \[Jammed\], you no longer have access to the device and may not control it until \[Jammed\] is removed.

**Removal:** When the device is moved beyond the range of the signal that is making it \[Jammed\], it loses the \[Jammed\] condition. At the end of a scene, if a device is \[Jammed\], it loses \[Jammed\].
