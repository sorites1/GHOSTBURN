## Setting the Difficulty Level

Each trick includes an entry for Difficulty Level (DL), which determines how difficult it is to execute. The DL for a trick is usually a **static DL** or based on an opponent's **traits**. Occasionally, a trick eschews the typical DL framework by calling for an **\[Opposed\] roll**. 

The only time the GM needs to set the DL themselves is when the rules don't cover the action a player wants their character to take. If the GM allows them it, the player can make roll it as an **improvised trick**, in which case the GM needs to define the DL for the roll.

### Difficulty Levels

Each **Difficulty Level (DL)** has a name and a number in parenthesis. When you make a roll, you compare the result (after applying bonuses) to the Difficulty Level to determine the outcome.

A Difficulty Level has a DL range associated with it, as shown below. For example, the DL range for Easy (8) goes from 8 to 13. The next Difficulty Level picks up where the last one stopped, so Moderate (14) goes from 14 to 19, and so on. Rolling above or below the target DL range changes the outcome of your roll, as described under **Outcomes** below.

There are five Difficulty Levels in this game: Easy (8), Moderate (14), Hard (20), Severe (26), and Extreme (32).

| Difficulty Level | DL Range |
| :--------------- | :------- |
| Extreme (32)     | 32 - 37  |
| Severe (26)      | 26 - 31  |
| Hard (20)        | 20 - 25  |
| Moderate (14)    | 14 - 19  |
| Easy (8)         | 8 - 13   |

### Traits as DLs

Some tricks use one of an opponent's **trait** as the base Difficulty Level. For example, Persuade (Convince) uses your opponent's Wits for the DL and Hacking (Street Hack) uses the \[Security\] rating of the target device.

Traits are expressed as Difficulty Levels. For example, Rico the food cart vendor has a Wits of Moderate (14), and the local Food Mart's payment system has a \[Security\] of Hard (20).

### Static DL

Some tricks simply state the DL to use. For example, Insight (Size Up Opponent) has a DL of Moderate (14).

### Opposed Rolls

Occasionally, the rules call for an \[Opposed\] roll, which means both you and the GM roll (and add your bonuses) and then compare your results to determine the outcome. As such, \[Opposed\] rolls do not use Difficulty Levels.

### Improvised Tricks

When these rules do not cover the action a player wants their character to perform, the GM can declare it an [[Keyword_Improvised_Trick|improvised trick]]. The GM sets the DL using their best judgement. Refer to the DL chart above and use one of the standard five Difficulty Levels: Easy (8), Moderate (14), Hard (20), Severe (26), and Extreme (32).
