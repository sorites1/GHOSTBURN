# SLAP Gun \[Augment\]

*The SLAP (Spring-Loaded Auto-Pistol) Gun by Ranco is a hidden firearm compartment. With a gesture, a hatch in your forearm pops open, and a Ripper AP9 light pistol springs out and pushes into your open hand, ready to fire.*

Activating SLAP Gun is free (0 AP). Activation causes you to equip the [[Light Pistol](../../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Light_Pistol.md)] hidden in your arm, and you may immediately use [Single Shot](../../../Skills_and_Tricks/Firearms/Single_Shot.md) or [Burst Fire](../../../Skills_and_Tricks/Firearms/Burst_Fire.md) at no additional AP cost. Stowing the weapon in its compartment costs 1 AP. 

SLAP Gun comes preloaded with a [Ranco Ripper AP9](../../../Gear_and_Augments/Firearms/Light_Pistols/Ranco_Ripper_AP9.md), but any \[Light Pistol\] (which may contain its own mods) can be mounted in its compartment. It costs 1 AP to mount or unmount a \[Light Pistol\], a task which can be performed anywhere and without the need for special tools. 

SLAP Gun can be installed as a [[Mod](../../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Mod.md)] in the [Cybernetic Arm](../../../Gear_and_Augments/Augments/Body_Augments/Cybernetic_Arm.md) augment.
