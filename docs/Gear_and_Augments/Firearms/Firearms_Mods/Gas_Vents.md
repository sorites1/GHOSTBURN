# Gas Vents

This [[Firearm](../../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Firearm.md)] includes \[Gas Vents\] which help reduce [[Recoil](../../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Recoil.md)]. There are two levels of \[Gas Vents\]: Gas Vents 1 and Gas Vents 2. Gas Vents 2 is an upgraded version and replaces Gas Vents 1; they do not stack.

* **Gas Vents 1** - Your second \[Attack\] with the same weapon on the same turn ignores \[Recoil\]. If you make a third \[Attack\], \[Recoil\] is applied. 

* **Gas Vents 2** - Your second and third \[Attack\] with the same weapon on the same turn both ignore \[Recoil\].

For example, the PX-90 comes with \[Gas Vents 1\], and it is a Rifle, which means it has the \[Recoil\] trait. The first shot with the PX-90 using the [[Burst Fire](../../../Skills_and_Tricks/Firearms/Burst_Fire.md)] trick has a DL of Hard (20). The second shot with Burst Fire on the same turn also has a DL of Hard (20) because Gas Vents 1 causes you to ignore \[Recoil\] on the second shot. The third shot with Burst Fire has a DL of Severe (26) because \[Recoil\] takes effect and raises the [Difficulty Level](../../../Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Difficulty_Level.md).
