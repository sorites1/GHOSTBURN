# 4. Your Turn

On your turn, you tell the GM what you want your character to do. You can also ask questions of the GM or other players, whether their characters are with you or not. While in-game actions and dice rolls are shared openly, players are expected to keep their characters' knowledge separate. Just because you heard it, doesn't mean your character did.

## Action Points

At the start of your turn, you get 3 Action Points (AP), which you can spend to take actions, such to [Move](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Move.md), or use a trick. On your turn, each action you take costs 1 AP. You cannot save AP turn over turn. If you decide to end your turn without spending all three AP, you lose the remainder (though they will refresh as normal at the start of your next turn).

## End of the Action

After the outcome of an action has been determined, that action is over. If the player has more action points, they may spend them to do more things. Otherwise, the player's turn is over and the next player's turn starts.
