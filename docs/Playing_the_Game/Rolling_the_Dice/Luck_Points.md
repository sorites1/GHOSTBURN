# 7. Luck Points

Luck Points can give you bonuses to your rolls and help you avoid glitches, as described below. You start the game with one Luck Point. 

## Spending a Luck Point

To use a Luck Point you must declare to the GM and the other players that you are using a Luck Point and how you are using it. There are two ways to use a Luck Point: 1) Get a Luck Bonus to a roll; and 2) Avoid a Glitch. 

For example, *"Dang, I rolled a glitch. I'll use a Luck Point to avoid it,"* or *"I just missed a Success on this roll, so I'll use a Luck Point to get a +2 Luck Bonus. That bumps me up to a Success!"*

### Luck Bonus

After you [Make a Roll](../../Playing_the_Game/Rolling_the_Dice/Making_a_Roll.md), you can spend a Luck Point to get a +2 Luck Bonus to your result, or a +3 Luck Bonus if you're using a favored skill.

### Avoid a Glitch

If you roll a Glitch, you can spend a Luck Point to [[Upgrade](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Upgraded.md)] the outcome to a Fade.

## Recovering Luck Points

At the start of each game session, your character recovers all of the Luck Points they previously spent. Some tricks and other effects can make you [[Lucky](../../Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Lucky.md)], which causes you to recover a Luck Point mid-session. 

## Buy Luck Points

In addition to the Luck Point you get at the start of the game, you can purchase up to two additional Luck Points for 10 XP each. You cannot have more than three Luck Points at any time. Luck Points you purchase are permanent additions to your character. They are spent and recovered as normal.
