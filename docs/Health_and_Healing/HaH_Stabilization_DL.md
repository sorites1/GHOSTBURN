# Stabilization DL

When your character is \[Dying\] or suffering from one of several other conditions, they need to be \[Stabilized\] by someone who can make a Medicine (First Aid) roll. Your \[Stabilization DL\] is the Difficulty Level used for those rolls.

Your \[Stabilization DL\] is based on your Resilience score, as shown below.
