# Sustaining an Injury

In this game, combat is dangerous, and its effects can be brutal. If you take enough damage, it can result in an injury, an enduring effect which might be easily resolved, could require surgery, or may even lead to cybernetic replacement.

## Injury Roll

The first time you drop to Death's Door in a scene, make an **Injury Roll**. Roll 2d10 and consult the **Injury Level Chart** below to determine if you sustain an injury. No matter how many times you drop to Death's Door in a single scene, you only make an Injury Roll once.

### Roll with +2

Some extra dangerous attacks available to the GM indicate that if the attack drops a character to Death's Door and triggers an **Injury roll**, the roll should be made with a +2. This +2 modifier applies to your roll on the Injury Level Chart and your subsequent roll on the specific Injury Chart (Minor, Significant, Terrible, Grievous, or Massive).

## Injury Level Chart

Make your Injury Roll and consult the Injury Level Chart below to determine your character's injury.

| Roll 2d10 | Injury Level       | Effect                                                         |
| :-------: | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    2-3    | None               | You do not sustain an injury. You gain \[Lucky\].              |
|    4-5    | Minor Injury       | You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Minor Injury Chart.       |
|    6-8    | Significant Injury | You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Significant Injury Chart. |
|   9-12    | Terrible Injury    | You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Terrible Injury Chart.    |
|   13-16   | Grievous Injury    | You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Grievous Injury Chart.    |
|   17-20   | Massive Injury     | You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Massive Injury Chart.     |

## Resist the Injury

If your Injury Roll was 4 or higher, it means you suffered an injury. However, your Resilience allows you to resist the injury. 

Make a [[Basic](../Keywords/Keyword_Basic.md)] Resilience roll with a Hard (20) DL. If you succeed, lower the Injury Level by one. If this reduces the Injury Level to None, then you do not sustain an injury.

For example, if you get an 11 on your Injury Roll, it means you have to roll on the Terrible Injury Chart. However, if you succeed on your \[Basic\] Resilience roll, the Injury Level is lowered by one from Terrible Injury to Significant Injury.  

## Specific Injury

If, after making a [[Basic](../Keywords/Keyword_Basic.md)] Resilience roll, you still sustain an injury, roll on the appropriate chart below to determine your specific injury. If you applied a +2 modifier when you rolled on the Injury Level Chart, you also apply a +2 modifier to this roll.

The charts below include a description of the injury, its mechanical effect, and the steps necessary for recovery. Medical science in the world of the GHOSTBURN has made such astounding advances that even the most critical of injuries can be treated so effectively that patients are fully recovered in a week's time.

## Qualifies for Field Surgery

Some injuries can be treated in the field, while others require the patient to be moved to a suitable [[Location](../Keywords/Keyword_Location.md)], such as a hospital. Refer to the description of [[Surgery](../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Medicine_Surgery.md)] for more information.
