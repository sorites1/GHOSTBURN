You rent a small, one-room apartment, which includes a cred-op faucet/toilet combo unit with sink, and a small kitchen area equipped to heat up prefab foodstuffs. Apartment buildings offer cred-op private showers on each floor, which are shared amongst the residents. In Ridgeworld, you live in the middle of the city, not at the top, but not at the bottom either. Your apartment building might be grungy, but crime is manageable and many neighborhoods have a bustling economy and active night life.
