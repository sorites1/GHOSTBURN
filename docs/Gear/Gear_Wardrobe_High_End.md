Just like the Basic Wardrobe, there are five versions of the High End Wardrobe, one for each Culture (Street, City, Milsec, Underworld, and Corporate). 

By spending 30 minutes, you can attempt to use your High End Wardrobe to create a [[Stunning Look](/../Keywords/Keyword_Stunning_Look)] or a [[Fierce Look](/../Keywords/Keyword_Fierce_Look)]. Tell the GM and the other players what kind of look you are trying to create and the Culture it will apply to. Then make a [[Basic](/../Keywords/Keyword_Basic)] Insight roll with a Moderate (14) DL. If you succeed, you gain the benefits the desired look. 

If you own all five High End Wardrobes, you gain a +2 [[Gear Bonus](/../Keywords/Keyword_Gear_Bonus)] to [Disguise](/../Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Deception_Disguise) rolls.
