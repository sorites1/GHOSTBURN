You have a spacious, luxury apartment with multiple bedrooms, multiple bathrooms, a kitchen worthy of a top chef, and top-of-the-line entertainment options. You even have enough room for a live-in steward or au pair. With massive, wall-to-ceiling windows, you regularly enjoy a spectacular view. In Ridgeworld, you are at the top of the ridge, so far up that you can barely even see those who live below you.
