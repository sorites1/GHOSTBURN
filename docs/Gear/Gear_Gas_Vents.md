## Gas Vents

This \[[[Keyword_Firearm|Firearm]]\] includes \[Gas Vents\] which help reduce \[[[Keyword_Recoil|Recoil]]\]. There are two versions of \[Gas Vents\]: Gas Vents 1 and Gas Vents 2. Gas Vents 2 is an upgraded version and replaces Gas Vents 1; they do not stack.

**Gas Vents 1** - Your second \[Attack\] with the same weapon on the same turn ignores \[Recoil\]. If you make a third \[Attack\], \[Recoil\] is applied. 

**Gas Vents 2** - Your second and third \[Attack\] with the same weapon on the same turn both ignore \[Recoil\].

For example, the PX-90 comes with \[Gas Vents 1\], and it is a Rifle, which means it has the \[Recoil\] trait. The first shot with the PX-90 using the \[[[Skills_and_Tricks/Trick_Firearms_Core_Burst_Fire|Burst Fire]]\] trick has a DL of Hard (20). The second shot with Burst Fire on the same turn also has a DL of Hard (20) because Gas Vents 1 causes you to ignore \[Recoil\] on the second shot. The third shot with Burst Fire has a DL of Severe (26) because \[Recoil\] takes effect and raises the [[MaR_Difficulty_Level|Difficulty Level]].
