# 6. Starting Package

Choose a starting package, or build your own. Starting characters get 30,000 ⌆ to spend on starting [Gear and Augments](/../Gear_and_Augments), which includes a starting [Lifestyle](/../Gear/Lifestyles). If you do not purchase a Lifestyle, you start on the [Street](/../Gear/Lifestyle_Street). Your starting package represents gear and augments you've accumulated over time or which you've recently obtained with the help of your medium. 

## Hacker
