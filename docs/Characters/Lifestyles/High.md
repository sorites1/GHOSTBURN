You have a well-appointment apartment with two bedrooms, a full kitchen, a private bathroom, high-end entertainment, and perhaps most importantly, a view. Your neighbors are polite if curt, and crime is virtually nonexistent. You are accustomed to eating quality food, real vegetables, fruits, and proteins, chicken, pork, and beef, even if they were technically grown in a lab. In Ridgeworld, your apartment is situated near the top, on the upper region of the ridge.
