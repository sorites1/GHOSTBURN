# 3. Contacts

A contact is someone you personally know and with whom you are on good terms. 

You can call on your contacts periodically to see if they can help you. Contacts can provide information, goods and services, or even a place to sleep. However, contacts won't go with you to a second location, nor will they fight for you.

You start the game with two contacts, one of which you get to choose and one given to you by your GM.

## Free Contact: Choose One from your Culture

Choose a contact that has the same culture as you. This person might be connected to your old life, they may have helped you when you got burned, or perhaps they even introduced you to your medium. Feel free to come up with a name and a few details about your contact. Write them down on your character sheet and share them with the GM. 

## Free Contact: Medium

Your medium is the person who "discovered" you after you got burned. They used their power and connections to erase your digital identity on the Net, turning you into a **ghost**. Your medium also put you together with the other ghosts in your crew. The GM will use your medium to offer you jobs, to provide you access to black market, and to assist with other things you might need. The GM will tell you the medium's name so you can write it down on your character sheet.
