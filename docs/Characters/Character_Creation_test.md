## Character Creation

In this game, each player creates a character to play. As the player, you make all the decisions about your character, including their background, natural abilities, skills, and so on. 

To create a character in ***GHOSTBURN 2325***, follow the steps below.

### 1. Background

Choose a [[Backgrounds|Background]] for your character. 

Your background describes who your character used to be and includes a culture, favored skill, and an additional benefit.
#### Background Name

Write the name of your background in the space labeled Background on your character sheet.
#### Culture

Your background gives you one Culture (Corporate, Milsec, Street, or Underworld). Write your culture in the space labeled Culture at the top of the character sheet.
#### Favored Skill

Your background gives you one favored skill. Fill in the diamond symbol (◇) next to the skill name on your character sheet to indicate it as a favored skill, and write +1 in its skill bonus box.

Later on in the game when you spend XP to improve your character, it costs fewer XP to improve favored skills and to purchase signature tricks associated with your favored skills as compared to non-favored skills. 
#### Additional Benefit

Your background also gives you an additional benefit which varies from one background to another. Your background may give you a piece of Gear, a cybernetic Augment, a Signature Trick, or even a bit of extra Luck. Write the additional benefit on your character sheet in the appropriate area. 

### 2. Burn and Hook

Choose a \[[[Burns_and_Hooks|Burn and Hook]]\] for your character.

Your burn is a pivotal event in your life and helps explain why your character is no longer living the life described by their background. Your hook represents the lasting consequences of the burn. 

Your background, burn, and hook should all tie together to show your character's story, like this: 

*I am a **\[Background\]** who was **\[Burned\]**, and now I am **\[Hook\]**.*

For example: 

*I am a **\[Street Vendor\]** who was **\[Witness\]** to a murder, and now I'm being **\[Hunted\]** by the megacorp that wants to silence me.*

Write your burn and hook at the top of your character sheet in the spaces labeled Burn and Hook, respectively.
