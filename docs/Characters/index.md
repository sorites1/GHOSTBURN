 In **GHOSTBURN**, you are a **Ghost**, someone whose digital identity has been erased. You live outside the system, doing work for your **Medium**, the one who reached out and helped you when your life was in shambles.

You didn't start out as a ghost. You had a life once. A career. A **Background**. But that old life went up in smoke when you got **Burned**. The street waits. It knows you, and it waits until you are at your most vulnerable. But before the street could take you, your medium found you and offered a deal.

You took it. 

Now, you do the jobs your medium brings. It's a different kind of work than what the corporate knobs do in their glass towers, but it's important, and it needs to get done. Megacorp media labels people like you as the bad guys. They call you criminals. Killers. Punks. And they're not totally off the mark, but they miss the nuance of what you're doing, the benefits you bring to society.

You make a difference, or, at least, you try. Some people out there have no other options. You exist to fill that void. Invisible and deadly. A ghost.
