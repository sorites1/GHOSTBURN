# 1. Choose a Background

Refer to the [Backgrounds List](../Characters/Char_Backgrounds.md) and choose one for your character. 

Your background describes who your character used to be and includes a culture, favored skill, and an additional benefit.

## Background Name

Write the name of your background in the space labeled Background on your character sheet.

## Culture

Your background gives you one Culture (Corporate, Milsec, Street, or Underworld). Write a +1 in the box next to your Culture in the Cultures section at the bottom of the character sheet.

## Favored Skill

Your background gives you one favored skill. Fill in the diamond symbol (◇) next to the skill name on your character sheet to indicate it as a favored skill, and write +1 in its skill bonus box.

!!! note "[INFO\] //Favored Skills"
    It costs fewer XP to improve favored skills and to purchase signature tricks for your favored skills than it does for non-favored skills.

## Additional Benefit

Your background also gives you an additional benefit, which varies from one background to another. Your background may give you a piece of Gear, a Cybernetic Augment, a Signature Trick, or even a bit of Extra Luck. Write the additional benefit on your character sheet in the appropriate area.
