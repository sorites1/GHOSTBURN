# 2. Burn and Hook

Look through the list of [Burns and Hooks](../../Characters/Character_Creation/Burns_and_Hooks.md) and choose one of each for your character.

Your **Burn** is a pivotal event in your life. It helps explain why your character is no longer living the life described by their **Background**. Your **Hook** represents the lasting consequences of the burn. 

| Your background, burn, and hook should all tie together to show your character's story                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Like this: <br><br>*I am a **\[Background\]** who was **\[Burned\]**, and now I am **\[Hook\]**.*                                                               |
| Example: <br><br>*I am a **\[Street Vendor\]** who was **\[Witness\]** to a murder, and now I'm being **\[Hunted\]** by the megacorp that wants to silence me.* |

Write your burn and hook at the top of your character sheet.
