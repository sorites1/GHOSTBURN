# GHOSTBURN 2325

This is the core document for GHOSTBURN 2325, a cyberpunk game set in
New North America, 300 years in the future.

# Round Robin: The Flow of the Game

This game uses a round robin turn-taking style for all scenes and
actions, including those in combat and out of combat. In fact, *this
game makes no distinction between combat and non-combat turns*.

It is possible for some players to be in combat while other players are
not. This does not alter the turn order. The game will always proceed in
a round robin manner, even if that means you end up with a mix, such as,
one player takes a turn in combat, the next player takes a turn *outside
of combat*, and the last player takes a turn *in a different combat*.

This game is designed to allow players to have their characters act
independently from one another without forcing anyone to "sit out" until
one group's actions have been resolved. Instead, this game blends
everyone's actions together in an orderly way by requiring everyone to
take turns.

## The Turn Order

Each time your group assembles, whether online or in person, to play the
game, the GM will start by setting the stage, reminding everyone of the
events of last session, and so on. Play begins with the player to the
GM's left. They describe what their character does, and the GM responds
accordingly. Then, play proceeds to the left and the next player takes a
turn, and so on, until everyone has taken a turn, and play comes back to
the GM.

## Your Turn

On your turn, you tell the GM what you want your character to do. You
can also ask questions of the GM or other players, whether their
characters are with you or not. While in-game actions and dice rolls are
shared openly, players are expected to keep their characters' knowledge
separate. Just because you heard it, doesn't mean your character did.

## Types of Turns

There are three types of turns in this game:

- **Regular Turn** -- A regular turn typically involves narration and
  may include the use of a few skill actions. You might describe your
  character doing something dangerous like sneaking into an abandoned
  warehouse. During your turn, the GM may call for up to three rolls,
  such as an Athletics roll to jump the fence, a Sneak roll to avoid
  notice, and a Computer roll to hack the lock. However, this is not a
  hard rule, and the GM is not required to call for three (or any)
  rolls. Regular turns are more unstructured and rely on both the GM and
  the player to regulate the amount of time spent on this turn.

- **Combat Turn --** A combat turn is strictly regimented by the use of
  3 Action Points (AP). At the start of your turn, you gain 3 AP if you
  are in combat. You may spend your AP as you wish throughout your turn.
  Once all of your AP is spent, or you do not wish to spend them all,
  your turn is over. See the Combat chapter for more information on
  spending AP.

- **GM Turn** -- When play comes back to the GM, it signals a potential
  escalation. The GM can use their turn to introduce new characters into
  a scene, whether in combat or not. The GM should also use their turn
  to run the opposition against those who are in combat.

Players should generally avoid interrupting other players on their
turns. However, if one player narrates an action that would directly
impact another player, the GM may allow the second player to react
directly before returning to the first player. Any reaction by a second
player should be minimal to preserve the first player's turn.

If you are unsure of what to do on your turn, the GM may also prompt you
with a question or two to help you identify possible actions your
character could take. However, you are not required to take an action on
your turn. You may pass.

## Group Turns

When the group is partially or completely together in the same place at
the same time, the GM is free to drop individual turns in favor of group
turns. Group turns offer a loose, collaborative segment in which players
share their ideas and narrate their character's actions without a formal
turn order. This is a great time to let the players show off their
characters' personalities and quirks, and it lets them roleplay with one
another.

Group turns are especially useful when time is compressed or actions are
routine, such as when traveling across the city, which could take a
couple of hours or more. If players prefer to stay in the round robin
turn order during group scenes, that is perfectly fine. Some players may
want the opportunity to narrate what their character is doing during
this moment of downtime.

Anyone not part of these group turns should still be given their
individual turns, whether regular or combat.

# Core Mechanic

When a player describes what their character is doing, the GM first
determines if a roll is necessary. If the task is trivial, impossible,
or carries no risk, such that a character could keep trying until they
were successful, then it is not necessary to roll.

+------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Task       | Resolution              | Examples                       |
+============+=========================+================================+
| Trivial    | You succeed             | Open a door                    |
|            |                         |                                |
|            |                         | Make a phone call              |
|            |                         |                                |
|            |                         | Log on to the Net              |
+------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Impossible | You cannot attempt      | Jump over a house              |
|            |                         |                                |
|            |                         | Run across water               |
|            |                         |                                |
|            |                         | Access cyberspace without      |
|            |                         | jacking in                     |
+------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
| No Risk    | Keep trying until you   | Climb over a small fence       |
|            | succeed                 |                                |
|            |                         | Navigate to an unfamiliar      |
|            |                         | destination                    |
|            |                         |                                |
|            |                         | Repair a piece of broken       |
|            |                         | equipment                      |
+------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+

It's important to realize that the same task can be performed
automatically when there is no risk but requires a roll when there is.
For example, climbing over a small fence is relatively easy to do but
still requires some effort. All else being equal, a character could keep
trying until they succeed; no need to roll. However, that same task
requires a roll if we introduce risk. For example, a character is being
chased and rounds the corner to see a small fence blocking their path.
Now, if the character decides to go over the fence, the GM should have
the player roll, even if the task is easy, because failure leads to
consequences (the pursuers catch up).

## Making a Roll

When the GM determines that a roll is necessary, they identify the skill
and ability score for the player to use, as well as the Difficulty Level
of the task. Difficulty Levels range from Automatic (2) to Extreme (22).

The player then makes a roll and adds the appropriate ability score to
get the result. Most of the time, the player will roll one d20 and add
their ability score. However, if the character is untrained in the skill
the GM calls for, they roll with Disadvantage, which means they roll two
d20s and take the lower of the two.

Compare the result to the target number set by the Difficulty Level. If
the result is equal to or greater than the target number, the character
succeeded (and may have critically succeeded). If the result is less
than the target number, the character failed (and may have critically
failed).

## Abilities

Each character is composed of the following abilities:

- **Strength --** A measure of a character's physical form and raw
  strength

- **Agility** -- Reflects a character's quickness, reaction speed, and
  manual dexterity

- **Intellect** -- Indicates a character's education and critical
  thinking

- **Perception** -- Represents a character's senses and is the source of
  psionic ability

- **Presence** -- A combination of raw magnetism, artistic talent, and
  social insight

- **Resilience** -- Mental and physical fortitude; resist injury and
  psychic burn

Each character has a number, called an ability score, associated with
each of their abilities, as shown below.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ability Score Ability Level   Description
  ------------- --------------- --------------------------------------------
        0       Incapable       Completely incapable, non-functional

        1       Feeble          Barely capable, like a small child

        2       Average         Human average, sufficient for most things in
                                life

        3       Impressive      A step up from most people, competent and
                                capable

        4       Exceptional     Better than most, a serious contender

        5       Amazing         Near the top, a thrill to behold

        6       Peak Human      The best of the best humankind has to offer

        7       Superhuman      Beyond human limits, breathtaking

        8       Extraordinary   Nearing limits of the animal kingdom, apex
                                predator

        9       Peak Animal     The best of the best the animal kingdom has
                                to offer

       10       Construct       Beyond the limits of the animal kingdom;
                                artificial

       11       Transcendent    Passing beyond humans\' ability to construct

       12       Legendary       Stories are told of such things,
                                awe-inspiring

       13       Unfathomable    Almost beyond comprehension, unimaginable

       14       Supreme         Nearly breaking the laws of nature,
                                mind-bending

       15       Absolute        Theoretical maximum, godlike capability
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hit Points

Your character's health is measured in hit points (hp) and is based on
your Strength and Resilience scores.

All characters get 10 hp (base) and add (Strength x 3) and (Resilience x
4).

For example, a character with Strength 2 and Resilience 4 would have:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Step       Hit Point Calculation
  ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------
         1         10 (Base) + (Strength 2 x 3) + (Resilience 4 x 4) =
                   Maximum hit points

         2         10 (Base) + 6 + 16

         3         10 (Base) + 22

         4         32 hp Max
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

To calculate your Health Levels, do the following:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Health Level Hit Points             Example with 32 hp Max
  ----------------- ---------------------- -------------------------------
            Healthy Max Hit Points         32 hp

            Wounded Half of Healthy        16 hp

   Severely Wounded Half of Wounded        8 hp

       Death's Door Half of Severely       4 hp
                    Wounded                
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stabilization DL

Your character sheet has an area for you to write your Stabilization DL.
This is the Difficulty Level used for a First Aid roll to apply the
\[Stabilized\] condition to your character.

Your Stabilization DL is based on your Resilience score, as shown below.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         Resilience Score         Stabilization DL
  ------------------------------- ---------------------------------------
                 1                Extreme (22)

                 2                Severe (18)

                 3                Hard (14)

                 4                Moderate (10)

                 5                Easy (6)

                 6                Automatic (2)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## \[Speed\] and \[Half-Speed\]

Your character has two derived scores called \[Speed\] and
\[Half-Speed\], which determine how far you can move in combat.

Your character's \[Half-Speed\] is equal to the sum of your character's
Strength and Agility scores. Your \[Speed\] score is equal to
\[Half-Speed\], multiplied by two.

For example, a character with a Strength of 2 and an Agility of 3 would
have a \[Half-Speed\] as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Step       \[Half-Speed\] Score Calculation
  ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------
         1         Strength 2 + Agility 3 = \[Half-Speed\] score in
                   meters

         2         2 + 3

         3         5

         4         \[Half-Speed\]: 5 meters
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

To calculate your character's \[Speed\], multiply your \[Half-Speed\] by
two, as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Step       \[Speed\] Score Calculation
  ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------
         1         \[Half-Speed\] 5 x 2 = \[Speed\] score in meters

         2         5 x 2

         3         10

         4         \[Speed\]: 10 meters
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

In combat, you can spend 1 AP to move a number of meters equal to your
\[Speed\] score. For example, a character with a \[Speed\] of 10 can
travel up to 10 meters in combat by spending 1 AP on their turn. You may
spend 2 AP to move twice or 3 AP to move three times.

Certain conditions and effects limit you to using only \[Half-Speed\]
action for 1 AP, or they may prevent you from completing your movement,
stopping you mid-movement at your \[Half-Speed\] point.

## Skills

The **Skills** chapter provides information on individual skills,
including the ability score typically associated with each and guidance
on setting Difficulty Levels. Each skill includes around six skill
actions that offer rules for adjudicating specific situations. For
example, the Influence skill includes the skill actions, Persuade,
Improve Attitude, Haggle, Command, Intimidate Person, and Intimidate
Group.

## Difficulty Level

Difficulty Level indicates how easy or hard it is to succeed on a task.
Each Difficulty Level includes a number in parenthesis behind the name.
There are six Difficulty Levels in this game: Automatic (2), Easy (6),
Moderate (10), Hard (14), Severe (18), and Extreme (22).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attempting something\...           Difficulty Level
  ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------
  Trivial                            Automatic (2)

  Minor                              Easy (6)

  Standard                           Moderate (10)

  Major                              Hard (14)

  Massive                            Severe (18)

  Monumental                         Extreme (22)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### DL Number

Each Difficulty Level includes a number in parenthesis. When you use a
skill action, you roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability score. Then
you compare the result to the DL number to determine success or failure.
For example, Easy (6) means the action is easy to do and requires you to
roll against a 6. If the result is a 6 or higher, your character
succeeds.

### Setting the Base Difficulty Level

Each skill action includes an entry for Difficulty Level.

#### Traits

Some skill actions use an opponent's trait as the Difficulty Level. For
example, Persuade uses the target's Wits, and Ghost Trace uses the
target system's Security trait.

Traits are only found in stat blocks for the opposition, never in
player-characters, and they are expressed as Difficulty Levels. For
example, Rico the food cart vendor has a Wits of Moderate (10), and the
local Food Mart's payment system has a Security of Hard (14).

#### Difficulty Level Chart

Sometimes, the GM is responsible for setting the base DL. As the GM, use
your common sense, along with the guidance provided in the DL chart of
the skill actions that use it to set a Difficulty Level.

### Adjusting the Difficulty Level

Before making a roll, adjust the base Difficulty Level of the task by
taking relevant qualities, conditions, and enhancements into account.

#### Qualities

Qualities are short, freeform descriptors that are not specifically
defined by the game's rules. A quality is an aspect of a person, place,
or thing. When the GM calls for a roll, each quality relevant to the
situation raises or lowers the Difficulty Level.

For example, Rico the food cart vendor has the quality, \[Needs the
Money\]. Qualities like this can help inform the GM's roleplaying and
decision making. A quality like \[Needs the Money\] means the character
probably prioritizes their income and savings over other aspects of
their life. They are likely to be thrifty or even penny-pinching.

Places and things can have qualities too. A night club might have the
qualities, \[Loud\], \[Dark\], and \[Packed\], or a wooden door could
have the quality, \[Solid Oak\], which speaks to its sturdiness and
difficulty to break down.

The same quality can raise one Difficulty Level while lowering another.
For example, the quality \[Dark\] makes it harder to scan the room and
find your friends, so it would raise the DL by one. On the other hand,
if you are trying to hide, the \[Dark\] is a benefit, so it would lower
the DL by one.

Qualities are added and removed as appropriate. For example, during the
day, when the maintenance crew is working, the night club no longer has
the qualities \[Dark\], \[Loud\], or \[Packed\] because the lights are
on, there's no music, and only a handful of workers are present.

#### Conditions

Conditions are temporary effects on people and are codified by these
rules. Distracted, Off Balance, and Hidden are examples of conditions
that could affect your character. Descriptions of each condition,
including how they affect your character, how long they last, and how to
get rid of them, can be found later in this book. As with qualities,
conditions can raise or lower Difficulty Levels, but they usually have
other effects as well.

#### Attitude

Using social skill actions on someone with a Hostile Attitude toward you
raises the Difficulty Level, and someone with a Friendly Attitude lowers
the Difficulty Level.

#### Enhancements

Weapons and gear often include (or can be modified to support) specific
features that raise or lower Difficulty Levels under specific
circumstances. For example, a weapon with recoil compensation lowers the
Difficulty Level of all attacks made with it. Goggles or cyber eyes with
low light vision balance the Difficulty Level of skill actions that
would otherwise be made more difficult in low light. These effects,
whether from a weapon, piece of gear, or cybernetic modification, are
collectively known as enhancements.

### Adjusting Difficulty Level: Step-by-Step

Adjusting the Difficulty Level of a roll is a joint activity carried out
by the GM and the player, together.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Step   Description                     Example
  ------ ------------------------------- ---------------------------------
  1      The player states what their    Player: *My character is trying
         character wants to do,          to convince Rico to give her a
                                         free taco.*

  2      The GM identifies the skill and GM: *OK, that's Persuade. You'll
         skill action to use, as well as roll with Presence. Persuade uses
         the base Difficulty Level for   Wits as the Difficulty Level, and
         the roll.                       Rico's Wits is Moderate (10), so
                                         that's the base Difficulty
                                         Level.*

  3      The GM announces each modifier  GM: *Rico's Attitude is currently
         that raises the Difficulty      \[Neutral\] towards you, so that
         Level. See the **Exceeding      doesn't change anything, but he
         Extreme (22)** sidebar.         also has three qualities: \[Loves
                                         Dogs\] -- which doesn't apply
                                         here -- and \[Needs the Money\]
                                         -- which does. He's also got
                                         \[Grumpy\] and that applies too.
                                         That raises the Difficulty Level
                                         two times (once for \[Needs the
                                         Money\] and once for \[Grumpy\]).
                                         So, the Difficulty Level goes
                                         from Moderate (10) to Severe
                                         (18).*

  4      The player announces each       Player: *My character has a
         modifier they have that lowers  pheromone implant, which
         the Difficulty Level.           decreases the Difficulty Level on
                                         Persuade rolls. So, that drops it
                                         back down from Severe (18) to
                                         Hard (14).*

  5      The player rolls and adds their Player: *I'm trained in
         character's ability score.      Influence, so I roll a d20 and
                                         add my Presence score, which is
                                         4. I rolled an 11. Adding 4, I
                                         have a result of 15.*

  6      Resolve the roll by comparing   Player: *I got a 15. The
         the result to the target number Difficulty Level was Hard (14),

|                                                                       |
| As you layer on more and more modifiers, you may find yourself going  |
| past Extreme (22). When this happens, keep going and refer to extra   |
| levels as Extreme (+1), Extreme (+2), etc.                            |
|                                                                       |
| For example, consider a character who is making an attack against a   |
| target.                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| - For this attack, the skill action dictates the base DL is Moderate  |
|   (10).                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| - The GM says the target is at long range.                            |
|                                                                       |
| - Each range increment beyond short raises the DL by one.             |
|                                                                       |
| - Going from short to medium range raises the DL to Hard (14).        |
|                                                                       |
| - Going from medium to long range raises the DL to Severe (18).       |
|                                                                       |
| - The GM adds \[Dark\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (22).   |
|                                                                       |
| - The GM adds \[Rain\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (+1).   |
|                                                                       |
| After the GM finishes raising the DL, proceed with lowering the DL    |
| according to modifiers identified by the player. If the player is     |
| unable to reduce the DL to Extreme (22) or lower, then what they are  |
| trying to do is not possible. You cannot make a roll if the DL is     |
| Extreme (+1) or higher.                                               |

## Outcomes

When you use a skill action, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability
score to get the result. Compare the result to the Difficulty Level
(DL).

If the result is equal to or greater than the DL, the character
succeeded. If you rolled a 20 on the die (without adding your ability
score), it's called a *Natural 20*, and it counts as a critical success.
Another way to get a critical success is if your result (including your
ability score) is higher than the DL by 10 or more.

If the result is less than the DL, the character failed. If you rolled a
1 on the die (without adding your ability score), it's called a *Natural
1*, and it counts as a critical failure. You can also get a critical
failure if your result (including your ability score) is less than the
DL by 10 or more.

### Stress and Choice

Some skill actions prescribe two other kinds of outcomes: stress and
choice. Stress means you suffer to a complication on a success or
critical success due to the extraordinary nature of what you're doing.
Choice means you or the GM are given a choice about what comes next.

Conditions are temporary statuses that can be applied to characters.
Each condition listed below includes its primary cause and often
suggests other possible causes, describes the effect the condition has
on a person, and explains how the condition is removed.

# Qualities

Qualities are features or aspects of a person, place, or thing. Usually
inherent and permanent, qualities can sometimes be temporary, such as
when a weapon gains a quality when a modular component like a scope is
added and then loses that quality when the component is removed.
Qualities are organized into different types.

## Environmental Qualities

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Quality         Type            Effect
  --------------- --------------- ----------------------------------------
  Dark            Environment     Total or near-total darkness, making it
                                  very difficult to see. Targets in the
                                  \[Dark\] have \[Total Concealment\] to
                                  you.

  Fog             Environment     Thick fog makes it difficult to see.
                                  Targets in \[Fog\] have \[Partial
                                  Concealment\].

  Ice             Environment     Icy surfaces are \[Slippery\].

  Rain            Environment     A steady rainfall makes it difficult to
                                  see and hear. Targets in the \[Rain\]
                                  have \[Partial Concealment\]. Perception
                                  rolls made to hear in the \[Rain\] have
                                  their DL raised by one.

  Slippery        Environment     This object or surface is very slick and
                                  hard to grip. To grab and hold an object
                                  that is \[Slippery\], you must succeed
                                  on an Agility roll with a Hard (14) DL.
                                  Failure means you drop it. To move

                                  hit a far-off target. When you make a
                                  \[Ranged\] attack with a firearm at a

# Influence (Presence)

Domains: Charm, Authority, Menace

The Influence skill governs most social interactions, unless you're
lying or being evasive, in which case you should use the Deception
skill. Broadly speaking, the Influence skill is used when you\'re
speaking truthfully and want something from another person, whether it
is information, cooperation, action, or a better price.

This skill is typically rolled with Presence, but the GM might decide to
call for Strength, such as when you literally strong arm someone to get
them to agree to your demands, or Intellect when you\'re impressing
someone with your raw intelligence.

## Influence Skill Actions

There are six Influence skill actions:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Skill Action    Domain         Description
  --------------- -------------- ----------------------------------------
  Persuade        Charm          Ask someone for help and offer nothing
                                 in return

  Improve         Charm          Raise a person\'s Attitude to Neutral or
  Attitude                       Friendly

  Haggle          Authority      Negotiate for the price of goods or
                                 services

  Command         Authority      Issue an order to someone and expect
                                 obedience

  Intimidate      Menace         Threaten someone into compliance
  Person                         

  Intimidate      Menace         Frighten a group of people into
  Group                          compliance
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Persuade

+---------------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a Neutral or Friendly person*      | *Difficulty Level: target's Wits*   |
+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: a few minutes*                   | *Domain: Charm*                     |
+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Vocal\], \[Language\], \[Attitude\], \[Social\]*                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Using flattery, charm, and a bit of psychology, you Persuade the target
to help you in some way, typically without offering anything in return.
The target won't act against their own self-interest, and they won't
agree to anything too risky or dangerous. If your request is
unreasonable, the GM should raise the DL by one. For a truly outrageous
request, the GM should raise the DL by two. Attempting to use Persuade
on a target with a Hostile Attitude automatically fails.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Result        Description
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  Success       The target agrees to help you. Depending on the nature of
                your request, the target may fulfill it immediately or
                over time. Complex or difficult requests may take days to
                complete.

  Critical      As success, but the target provides more or better help
  Success       or completes your request in half the time.

  Failure       The target refuses to help. You can only use Persuade on
                the target again if something changes, such as offering
                something of value in exchange for help, providing
                compelling new information, or asking for less.

  Critical      As failure, but the target's Attitude drops by one.
  Failure       
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Improve Attitude

+---------------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a Neutral or Hostile person*       | *Difficulty Level: target's Wits*   |
+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: 10 minutes*                      | *Domain: Charm*                     |
+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Vocal\], \[Language\], \[Auditory\], \[Attitude\], \[Social\]*       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Improve Attitude, you engage the target in conversation,
showing generosity, empathy, and finding common interests, with the
intent of improving your relationship.

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Result     | Description                                             |
+============+=========================================================+
| Success    | You improve the target\'s Attitude by one level, from   |
|            | Hostile to Neutral or from Neutral to Friendly.         |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As success, but you gain an insight into the target's   |
| Success    | psyche. The next time you use a \[social\] skill action |
|            | on the target, the DL for that roll is lowered by one.  |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | The target's Attitude remains unchanged. You may try    |
|            | again, unless this was your second failed attempt in a  |
|            | row.                                                    |
|            |                                                         |
|            | **Choice:** If this was your second failed attempt in a |
|            | row, you must choose to either **Back Off** or **Press  |
|            | the Issue**.                                            |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose to **Back Off**, you must leave the     |
|            |   target alone for at least an hour before trying       |
|            |   again.                                                |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you **Press the Issue**, you try again, but if you |
|            |   fail, it is treated as a critical failure.            |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As failure, but the target\'s Attitude drops one level. |
| Failure    | If the target was already Hostile, they \[Break\].      |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

| #### NPC Attitudes                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| NPCs have a trait called Attitude, which reflects how they view you   |
| at the present time. A person's Attitude tends to stay the same over  |
| time unless you give them a reason to change. There are three         |
| Attitudes, and you can think of them as being on a spectrum:          |
| Friendly, Neutral, and Hostile.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| - **Friendly** -- Sees you as a friend. Conversations can be serious, |
|   at times, and disagreements are resolved amicably. Easily willing   |
|   to provide help without expecting anything in return and might do a |
|   lot more for the right reason or price. If the target is Friendly,  |
|   skill actions with the \[Attitude\] keyword have their DL lowered   |
|   by one.                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| - **Neutral** -- Regards you with caution or indifference. Attempts   |
|   at normal conversation are typically reciprocated, up to a point.   |
|   May be willing to help with minor requests but has reservations     |
|   about doing more.                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| - **Hostile** -- Dislikes you and is generally uninterested in        |
|   working with you or helping you. Attempts at conversation are       |
|   typically ignored or devolve into yelling. May try to restrain you, |
|   physically move you, or attack you, especially if provoked. If the  |
|   target is Hostile, skill actions with the \[Attitude\] keyword have |
|   their DL raised by one.                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

##  Haggle

+---------------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a Neutral or Friendly person*      | *Difficulty Level: target's Wits*   |
+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: a few minutes*                   | *Domain: Authority*                 |
+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Vocal\], \[Language\], \[Auditory\], \[Attitude\], \[Social\]*       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

With a combination of confidence, market knowledge, and a bit of savvy,
you use Haggle to negotiate over the price of goods or services. This
process involves some back-and-forth as the two parties try to get the
better deal, but in this game, it is handled with a single roll. In some
situations, such as when you purchase from a fixed-price vendor, it is
not possible to haggle. Using Haggle on a Hostile target automatically
fails.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Result        Description
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  Success       If the target is selling you something, you get a 20%
                discount. If they are buying something from you, they
                offer 20% more than the standard price.

  Critical      As success, but the modifier increases to 40% or the
  Success       target throws in "a little something extra" to keep you
                happy.

  Failure       The target refuses to budge. If you want to buy the item,
                you have to pay full price. If the target is buying from
                you, they offer the standard amount. You can use Haggle
                to try and negotiate with the target for other items.

  Critical      As failure, but the target refuses to do business with
  Failure       you right now. The target's Attitude drops by one. You
                can only use Haggle on the target again if their Attitude
                becomes Friendly.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Command

+---------------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a person*                          | *Difficulty Level: Fortitude*       |
+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: a few seconds*                   | *Domain: Authority*                 |
+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Vocal\], \[Language\], \[Attitude\], \[Social\]*                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Command, you project confidence and issue the target a
firm, direct order intended to be followed without question. Your
instruction must be short and clear, such as, "Stop where you are,"
"Take cover!" or "Suppressive fire!" You must roll for each order you
issue.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Result        Description
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  Success       The target defers to your authority and obeys your
                command.

  Critical      As success, but the target now sees you as a leader, even
  Success       if only temporarily. They follow your subsequent commands
                without requiring additional rolls for the duration of
                the scene. Their Attitude shifts to Friendly.

  Failure       The target does not respect your authority and refuses to
                obey. Their Attitude drops by one level.

  Critical      As failure, but the target's Attitude shifts to Hostile.
  Failure       If they were already Hostile, they \[Break\].
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Intimidate Person

+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a person*                      | *Difficulty Level: target's         |
|                                         | Fortitude*                          |
+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: a minute*                    | *Domain: Menace*                    |
+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Vocal\], \[Language\], \[Attitude\], \[Social\]*                 |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Intimidate, you force the target to follow your
instructions through threats of violence, loss of income, damage to
reputation, or some other unpleasantness.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Result        Description
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  Success       The target is \[Compliant\]. The GM may require you to
                make additional Intimidate rolls if you escalate the
                situation by forcing the target to do more and worse
                things. If you fail on a subsequent Intimidate roll
                against the target, they automatically \[Break\].

  Critical      As success, but the target is so shaken that you can
  Success       leave them unattended and they will remain \[Compliant\]
                unless something changes, such as the arrival of the
                target's allies or a shift in circumstance. However, left
                alone to their own devices, they will not act against
                you.

  Failure       The target is not threatened by you and will not follow
                your instructions. The target's Attitude drops one level.
                You can only use Intimidate on this target again if the
                situation changes in a meaningful way, such as by
                shifting the power dynamic, applying additional pressure,
                or introducing new leverage.

  Critical      As failure, but the target's Attitude shifts to Hostile.
  Failure       If the target was already Hostile, they \[Break\].
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intimidate Group

+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a group of people*          | *Difficulty Level: group size, see  |
|                                      | chart*                              |

| *Duration: a minute*                 | *Domain: Menace*                    |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Vocal\], \[Language\], \[Social\]*                            |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Intimidate Group, you scare a group of people into being
\[Compliant\]. You engage in violent or threatening behavior, such as
shouting, hurling insults, firing your weapon, damaging the environment
(punching walls, flipping tables), or physical intimidation, like
lunging. The demands you make must be short and understandable, and they
must apply to the entire group, such as "Everybody on the floor!"

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Difficulty Description              Example
            Level                          
  --------------- ------------------------ -------------------------------
         Easy (6) Up to 10 people          Dive bar on an off night

    Moderate (10) Up to 25 people          Small restaurant

        Hard (14) Up to 50 people          Main lobby of a large bank

      Severe (18) Up to 100 people         Art show featuring a rising
                                           star

| Success    | The group is \[Compliant\] for now.                     |
|            |                                                         |
|            | **Stress:** You have a limited amount of time before    |
|            | someone in the group snaps. At the start of your turn,  |
|            | make a basic Presence roll against an Easy (6) DL.      |
|            | Failure means one person in the group suffers a         |
|            | \[Break\]. Each turn, raise the DL by one.              |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As success, but ignore **Stress**.                      |

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | The group is not scared of you. Some jeer or throw      |
|            | things at you. If the group has more than 25 people in  |
|            | it, one of them suffers a \[Break\] and comes at you.   |
|            |                                                         |

|            | - If you **Deal with It**, you may take up to a minute  |
|            |   to respond to the lone rogue who is challenging you.  |
|            |   The solution you implement is up to you, but if it    |
|            |   would reasonably strike fear into the hearts of       |
|            |   onlookers, then this failure on Frighten Group        |
|            |   becomes a success. However, failure to frighten the   |
|            |   group with your response turns this failure into a    |
|            |   critical failure.                                     |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you **Get Out**, then you abandon your attempt to  |
|            |   Intimidate Group and leave before they all turn on    |
|            |   you.                                                  |

# Deception (Presence)

Domains: Craft, Perform, Trickery

The Deception skill covers lying, misdirection, manipulation, and
disguise. Use Deception whenever you're being deceptive or evasive,
whether lying, fabricating a story to get out of a jam, or creating a
distraction so the rest of your team can slip past.

If you're speaking truthfully, use the Influence skill instead.

Deception is most often used with Presence, but the GM might decide
Intellect is appropriate when trying to outmaneuver a particularly sharp
opponent.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

You create a physical disguise for yourself or someone else, using
fashion, makeup, props, and prosthetics. When you use Disguise, you
assemble a "look" meant to either conceal a person\'s identity or help
them impersonate someone specific. \[Supplies\] include things like
clothing, hats, shoes, wigs, makeup, or fake facial features, such as
mustaches, beards, noses, and chins.

You select a Difficulty Level based on the complexity and intended
outcome of the disguise you're trying to create. The more convincing or
specific the disguise needs to be, the harder it is and the longer it
takes.

## Forgery

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: None*                      | *Difficulty Level: replica quality, |
|                                     | see chart*                          |

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Tools\], \[Supplies\], \[Location\], \[Fine Control\]*       |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Forgery, you attempt to create a convincing replica of a
physical object. This could be a valuable item like a piece of jewelry
or artwork, or something more mundane, like a childhood toy or a
worn-out chair.

Forgery cannot be used to create functioning electronics, but you can
conceal a small, preassembled device inside a replica. Doing so raises
the DL by one.

You select a Difficulty Level based on the complexity and intended
outcome of the replica. The more convincing or intricate the object, the
harder it is and the longer it takes to produce.

## Street Hustle

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a Neutral or Friendly      | *Difficulty Level: target\'s Wits*  |
| person*                             |                                     |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Attitude\], \[Auditory\], \[Visual\], \[Fine Control\],      |
| \[Social\]*                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Street Hustle, you run quick, street-level con using fast
talk, misdirection, and sleight of hand. The exact form of the scam is
up to you, but common examples include bumping into someone to
pickpocket or plant an item and *Three Card Monte*, where the target
pays to guess which of three cards is the Queen of Hearts. Work with the
GM to describe other scams your character might run with Street Hustle.

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Result     | Description                                             |
+============+=========================================================+
| Success    | You con the target. If you ran a con like *Three Card   |
|            | Monte*, you took a little bit of their money (about 5   |
|            | cred). If you pickpocketed or planted something on      |
|            | them, you do so without being noticed.                  |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As success, but if you ran a con, you get twice the     |
| Success    | money (about 10 cred). If you pickpocketed or planted   |
|            | something, you also discover something useful about the |
|            | target or acquire an unexpected item (GM's discretion). |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | The target doesn't fall for it. If it was a con like    |
|            | *Three Card Monte*, they see what you're doing and call |
|            | out the scam. If you tried pickpocket or plant          |
|            | something, you are caught in the act. In both cases,    |
|            | you must make a choice.                                 |
|            |                                                         |
|            | **Choice:** You can either **Talk Your Way Out** or     |
|            | **Make a Break for It**.                                |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you decide to **Talk Your Way Out**, roll for      |
|            |   Bluff or Intimidate Person against the target.        |
|            |   Success means the target leaves you alone. However,   |
|            |   failing your Bluff or Intimidate roll turns this      |
|            |   failure into a critical failure.                      |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you decide to **Make a Break for It**, you flee.   |
|            |   If the target decides to chase you (GM's discretion), |
|            |   the GM may call for a Pursuit to resolve that         |
|            |   activity.                                             |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As failure, but the target becomes irate, and their     |
| Failure    | Attitude shifts to Hostile. If you try to **Talk Your   |
|            | Way Out**, the DL of your Bluff or Intimidate roll is   |
|            | raised by one. If you try to **Make a Break for It**,   |
|            | the target chases you.                                  |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

##  Blend In

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a group of people*         | *Difficulty Level: social rigidity, |
|                                     | see chart*                          |

| *Keywords: \[Visual\], \[Auditory\], \[Social\]*                          |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you find yourself in an unfamiliar social setting, you can use
Blend In to absorb the sights and sounds of the local atmosphere and
adjust your behavior to appear comfortable, natural, and accepted. This
helps you avoid suspicion and social exclusion.

If your appearance clashes with the norms of this setting, raise the
Difficulty by one. If your clothing is wildly inappropriate, raise the
Difficulty by two.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

+============+=========================================================+
| Success    | You blend into the social environment. You are free to  |
|            | roam and engage with people without being treated as an |
|            | outsider. Until the end of the scene, when you interact |
|            | with people in the area, treat them as having a         |
|            | Friendly Attitude.                                      |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As success, but you are treated with respect or seen as |
| Success    | an insider. You gain access to restricted areas, items, |
|            | and individuals that are typically off-limits to most   |
|            | people in this social environment.                      |

|            | **Choice:** You can either **Make a Show** or **Slink   |

|            | - If you **Make a Show**, describe what you are doing.  |
|            |   You draw attention to yourself and do something to    |
|            |   ingratiate yourself with the social group. For        |
|            |   example, you execute an amazing guitar solo among     |
|            |   music lovers, pontificate loudly about pop culture at |
|            |   a game con, or give a waiter a major dressing down at |
|            |   an upscale restaurant. Make another roll to Blend In, |
|            |   but this time, a failure is treated as a critical     |
|            |   failure.                                              |

##  Bluff

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a person*                  | *Difficulty Level: target\'s Wits*  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: a minute*                | *Domain: Trickery*                  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Vocal\], \[Language\], \[Attitude\], \[Social\]*             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Bluff, you attempt to deceive the target by lying, twisting
the truth, or omitting key information.

If your Bluff is particularly hard to believe, raise the DL by one. If
it is truly outrageous, raise the DL by two.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Result        Description
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  Success       The target believes you.

  Critical      As success, but the target is so thoroughly convinced
  Success       that they will defend you or vouch for you if questioned
                by others.

  Failure       The target sees through your deception and becomes
                \[Suspicious\]. Their Attitude drops by one level.

  Critical      As failure, but the target's Attitude shifts to Hostile.
  Failure       If they were already Hostile, they \[Break\].

| *Target: a person*                  | *Difficulty Level: target\'s Wits*  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: a few seconds*           | *Domain: Trickery*                  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Vocal\], \[Language\], \[Attitude\], \[Visual\], \[Social\]* |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Misdirect, you attempt to divert the target's attention
away from something you don't want them to see. This creates a brief
window of opportunity for you or one of your allies to act unnoticed.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Result        Description
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  Success       The target becomes \[Distracted\]. You or one of your
                allies may immediately use a skill action with a Duration
                of a minute (or less), such as Slip Past, Silent
                Takedown, Hide, Street Hustle (Pickpocket), or Grab.

  Critical      As success, but the target is \[Bewildered\] instead. You
  Success       and each of your allies may immediately use a skill
                action with a Duration of a minute (or less), such as
                Slip Past, Silent Takedown, Hide, Street Hustle
                (Pickpocket), or Grab.

  Failure       The target is not distracted and becomes \[Suspicious\].
                You cannot use Misdirect on them again unless you can
                think of a new way to distract them.

  Critical      As failure, but the target's Attitude shifts to Hostile.
  Failure       If they were already Hostile, they \[Break\].

# Insight (Presence)

Domains: Deduction, Empathy, Intuition

The Insight skill governs your ability to read people. It lets you
detect lies, uncover hidden motives, and sense unspoken emotions. By
examining body language and subtle social cues, you can sense a person's
intentions or interpret the dynamics of a group.

Use Insight when you want to know what someone is really thinking or
feeling. This skill lets you assess their honesty, read their emotional
state, and evaluate how dangerous they might be in a fight.

Where Influence is used to change someone's mind and Deception to create
falsehoods, Insight helps you see the truth.

This skill is primarily used with Presence, but the GM may call for it
to be used with Intellect in situations involving an unfamiliar culture,
a complex belief system, or an alien personality.

## Insight Skill Actions

There are five Insight skill actions:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Skill Action     Domain        Description
  ---------------- ------------- ----------------------------------------
  Detect Lies      Deduction     Listen and watch to know if someone is
                                 lying

  Discern Intent   Deduction     Deduce someone's motivations, short term
                                 goals

  Sense Emotions   Empathy       Sense someone's unspoken emotions

  Read the Room    Intuition     Survey the area to get a sense of what's
                                 going on

  Size Up Opponent Intuition     Quickly assess someone's threat level

+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Auditory\], \[Language\], \[Visual\], \[Social\]*               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

you observe their body language, tone, and cadence of speech. You are
alert for inconsistencies and contradictions with known facts, ready to
identify lies, mischaracterizations, and other forms of verbal deceit.

in the current situation. That is, you try to deduce their short-term
goals.

When you enter a scene where people are present, you watch and listen.
You may decide to slowly wander about in the area or stay in place,
whichever allows you to get a sense of power dynamics, underlying
tensions, and alliances. Despite its name, Read the Room can be used in
any social setting, not just those that take place inside a room.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

You size up the target to get a sense of how they\'d fair in a fight.
You watch the target and observe their stance, the way they move, and
the things they notice. You evaluate their loadout, their weapons,
armor, and cybernetics, including those you can see and those you can
guess the target might have. If the target has concealed weapons or
cybernetic implants, raise the DL by one.

# Firearms (Agility)

Domains: Spray, Style, Takedown

The Firearms skill covers the use of pistols, shotguns, submachine guns,
and rifles. Beyond pointing your weapon and pulling the trigger (a skill
action called Single Shot, described below), the Firearms skill is used
for special techniques.

Use Firearms to make controlled bursts lay down suppressive fire, or
attack at point blank range. Called shots let you apply status effects
and potentially deal extra damage, and dual wielding pistols or
submachine guns pack an extra punch in style.

## Firearms Skill Actions

There are seven Firearms skill actions:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Skill Action    Domain        Description
  --------------- ------------- -----------------------------------------
  Quick Shot      Style         You draw your gun and fire in a single
                                motion

  Dual Wield Guns Style         You fire a gun in each hand
                                simultaneously

  Controlled      Spray         You hit a target with a three-round burst
  Burst                         

  Sustained Fire  Spray         You lay down suppressive fire on your
                                enemies

  Single Shot     Takedown      You make a single shot from your weapon

  Point Blank     Takedown      You put your weapon to the target and
  Shot                          fire

  Called Shot     Takedown      You target a specific body part for
                                special effect
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Shot

+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a person*                      | *Difficulty Level: Moderate (10)*   |
+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Cost: 1 AP*                            | *Domain: Style*                     |
+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Attack\], \[Ranged\], \[Visual\], \[One Hand\]. \[Semi-Auto\]*   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Quick Shot, you make an attack against a target within
short range. You must either be wielding a pistol or a revolver, or have
one holstered, in which case you draw and shoot in a single motion (no
additional cost). You cannot use two hands for this attack.

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Result     | Description                                             |
+============+=========================================================+
| Success    | You hit the target and deal damage according to your    |
|            | weapon's damage array and the damage degree of your     |
|            | roll.                                                   |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As success, but you also have a **Choice**.             |
| Success    |                                                         |
|            | **Choice:** You can either perform a **Ranged Disarm**  |
|            | or **Another One**.                                     |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose **Ranged Disarm**, the target           |
|            |   immediately drops whatever they are holding. If the   |
|            |   target is not holding anything or is unable to drop   |
|            |   what they are holding (due to it being tied to them,  |
|            |   for example), then **Ranged Disarm** has no effect.   |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose **Another One**, you immediately attack |
|            |   with Quick Shot again at no cost.                     |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | Your shot misses or fails to penetrate the target's     |
|            | armor. No damage is dealt.                              |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As failure, but the GM also has a **Choice**.           |
| Failure    |                                                         |
|            | **Choice:** The GM can either have the enemy **Rush     |
|            | Attack** or **Run Away**.                               |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If the GM chooses **Rush Attack**, the target moves   |
|            |   into touch range and immediately makes an \[Attack\]  |
|            |   or \[Grapple\] against you.                           |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If the GM chooses **Run Away**, the target disengages |
|            |   and attempts to flee. If the target gets far enough   |
|            |   away, they escape or trigger a [Pursuit]{.mark} (GM's |
|            |   discretion).                                          |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

## Dual Wield Guns

+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: one or two persons*            | *Difficulty Level: Moderate (10)*   |
+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Cost: see text*                        | *Domain: Style*                     |
+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Attack\], \[Ranged\], \[Visual\], \[Two Hands\]. (\[Semi-Auto\]  |
| or \[Burst Fire\])*                                                           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Dual Wield Guns, you fire both of your weapons
simultaneously. You must have identical weapons, one in each hand, and
they must be in the same firing mode.

You may choose to either attack a single target or two different
targets, as detailed below.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Targets      Cost          Description
  ------------ ------------- --------------------------------------------
  One target   2 AP          Make one attack roll; if you succeed, both
                             weapons hit and damage the same target

  Two targets  3 AP          Make two attack rolls, raise the DL for each
                             by one; resolve these two attacks separately
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

|            | - **One Target:** If you attacked one target, both of   |
|            |   your weapons deal damage. Calculate damage using one  |
|            |   of your weapons' damage arrays and the damage degree  |
|            |   of your roll. Then multiply the damage by 2.          |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - **Two Targets (One Hit):** If you attacked two        |
|            |   targets, but got only one success, you deal damage to |
|            |   that target according to your weapon's damage array   |
|            |   and the damage degree of your roll.                   |

|            | - **Two Targets (Both Hit):** If you succeeded on both  |
|            |   of your rolls, you deal damage to both targets.       |
|            |   Calculate damage according to your weapons\' damage   |
|            |   arrays and the individual damage degrees of your two  |
|            |   rolls.                                                |

# Stealth (Agility)

Domains: Observation, Sneak, Celerity

The Stealth skill is used to avoid being seen or heard. By recognizing
sight lines, moving on light feet, and using cover and concealment, you
can try to remain unnoticed by human and electronic observers alike.
This skill is typically used with your Agility score, but the GM may
call for it to be used with Resilience at times, such as when you are
required to maintain an uncomfortable position to remain undetected.

Beyond simply hiding and moving silently, Stealth allows you to covertly
tail a target by following behind but remaining unobtrusive. If you can
get close enough to a target without being detected, you can try to
eavesdrop on their conversation, slip past them undetected, or use your
melee skills to take them down silently.

## Stealth Skill Actions

There are six Stealth skill actions:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Skill Action    Domain        Description
  --------------- ------------- -----------------------------------------
  Hide            Sneak         Hide where you cannot be directly
                                observed

  Move Silently   Sneak         Move while actively avoiding making noise

  Shadow Target   Observation   Follow someone without being discovered

  Eavesdrop       Observation   Listen in on someone else's conversation

  Slip Past       Celerity      Move past someone without being noticed

  Silent Takedown Celerity      Move into position behind someone and
                                attack
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hide

+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: potential observer(s)*            | *Difficulty Level: Moderate \[10\]* |
+--------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Cost: 2 AP*                               | *Domain: Sneak*                     |
+--------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Visual\]*                                                           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Hide, you position yourself in such a way that you cannot
be directly seen by potential observers, typically because something is
blocking line of sight, such as a wall, door, furniture, or terrain.

You can only use Hide if you are \[Undetected\] to potential observers.
In other words, if someone sees or hears you, and then you try to use
Hide, you will not be \[Hidden\], even if the person can no longer see
you. Consider two people, Alice and Bob, standing in a bedroom. Alice
goes into the closet and shuts the door. Bob can no longer see or hear
Alice (the closet door is in the way), but because he saw her go into
the closet, he knows where she is. Alice is not \[Hidden\] because she
is not \[Undetected\].

Now imagine Alice is in the bedroom when she hears someone enter the
house. She goes into the closet and closes the door to Hide. She is
\[Undetected\] by him, so this action is allowed. When Bob comes through
the house looking for her, and he looks in the bedroom, she is
\[Hidden\]. Bob didn't see her go into the closet, so he doesn't know
she's there.

If you need to move to the spot where you want to Hide, the GM might
call for a Move Silently roll if it's possible that potential observers
could hear you (thus, removing your \[Undetected\] condition and
preventing you from being able to Hide).

To fully conceal your body and gear, you may need to crouch or go prone,
such as if you were attempting to hide behind a 3-foot-tall concrete
barricade.

An observer that moves to a new vantage point that allows them to see or
hear you means you lose your \[Undetected\] condition and are no longer
\[Hidden\].

+============+=========================================================+
| Success    | You are \[Hidden\]. You remain hidden unless a target   |
|            | moves to a vantage where they can see you, or you       |
|            | perform an action that would reveal your location.      |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As success, but you are so well hidden that if you are  |
| Success    | seen, you may immediately use a 1 AP skill action at no |
|            | cost (0 AP) before the observer has a chance to alert   |
|            | others, attack, or take any other action.               |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | You are not hidden. You realize that the hiding place   |

You take careful steps and actively try to avoid making any noise while
moving. When you use Move Silently, you move at \[Half-Speed\].

You can only use Move Silently if you are \[Undetected\] to potential
observers. In other words, if someone sees or hears you, and then you
try to use Move Silently, it will have no result.

Consider two people, Alice and Bob, standing at opposite ends of the
living room. Alice uses Move Silently to cross the room, and Bob watches
her do this. He might not be able to hear her movement, but she is not
\[Undetected\] by him, so her use of Move Silently has no effect.

Now imagine Bob is in the living room watching TV with his back to the
doorway. Alice enters through the doorway and uses Move Silently to
cross the room, behind Bob. She is \[Undetected\] by him, so this action
is allowed. If she can make it through the next doorway into another
room without being heard, she will have avoided detection.

## Shadow Target

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a person*                  | *Difficulty Level: target's Wits*   |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: as long as it takes*     | *Domain: Observation*               |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Shadow Target, you discretely follow someone that you can
see. To be an effective tail, you must leave enough distance between
yourself and the target, or else you risk being noticed. At the same
time, you must stay close enough to the target that you can keep them in
your sights.

You can only use Shadow Target on a target to whom you are
\[Undetected\]. If you are not \[Undetected\] by the target, you can
still follow them, but they will be aware you are doing so, and such an
action does not qualify for Shadow Target.

The scope of Shadow Target includes the distance from one location to
another. Every new destination along the target's route requires another
Shadow Target roll. For example, following the target from their
starting point to their first destination (a flower shop) is covered by
your first Shadow Target roll. If the target then leaves the first
destination and travels to a second destination (a food mart), that
requires a second Shadow Target roll.

You may use Shadow Target with any mode of transport, such as on foot,
bicycle, or by motorized vehicle.

|            |   ends. On your next turn, the target continues         |
|            |   traveling to their destination, and you can use       |

|            |   The DL for your chosen action is raised by one. You   |
|            |   lose \[Undetected\]. The target becomes               |

|            |   The nature of this confrontation is up to the GM, but |
|            |   it should be loud and in your face. Depending on who  |

When you use Eavesdrop, you move to a position that puts you close
enough to a conversation that you can overhear what is being said, while
also staying far enough away that no one becomes \[Suspicious\].

Using Partial or Total Concealment to your advantage is preferred, as
this allows you to listen in without being obtrusive.

If you have successfully used Blend In this scene, lower the DL for your
Eavesdrop roll by one.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Slip Past, you quickly move past someone, such as a
bouncer, bodyguard, or ticket taker, that is between you and an area you
want to go to.

Before you can use Slip Past, you must position yourself a short
distance (equal to or less than \[Half-Speed\]) from the target. You may
need to use Move Silently, Hide, or Blend In so you can maneuver into
position.

The target must not be \[Suspicious\] of you, and you must be able to
see the target so you can anticipate an opportunity to use Slip Past.
You wait until the moment is right and then make your move to get past
the target without being noticed.

An ally who successfully uses Misdirect on the target creates an opening
for you to use Slip Past. Otherwise, you can wait for an open to occur
naturally, though there is no guarantee such a thing will happen. A
natural opening, as narrated by the GM, might be created by any kind of
temporary distraction, such as a side conversation, bending to tie a
shoe, or a nearby commotion.

|            | additional action with a Duration of *a few seconds* or |
|            | a Cost of 1 AP (which may trigger combat).              |

## Silent Takedown

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a person*                  | *Difficulty Level: target's Wits*   |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: a few seconds*           | *Domain: Celerity*                  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Visual\], \[Auditory\], \[Attack\], (\[Short Blade\], \[Long |
| Blade\], or \[Unarmed\])*                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Silent Takedown, you approach the target from behind, cover
their mouth, and perform a silent melee attack against them.

Before you can use Silent Takedown, you must position yourself a short
distance (equal to or less than \[Half-Speed\]) behind the target. You
must be \[Undetected\] by the target and may need to use Move Silently
or Hide to maneuver into position.

For Silent Takedown to be effective, the target needs to be alone, else
the second person will likely cry out or raise an alarm when they
witness you attacking the target. The only exception is when you work
with others to use Silent Takedown simultaneously against all targets
present.

|            | make, and with the other, you use Finishing Move to     |
|            | make an attack that is so silent it does not alert      |
|            | potential observers nearby. Make a Finishing Move roll  |

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | You fail to execute Silent Takedown. The target becomes |

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As failure, but you so badly bungle the attempt that    |
| Failure    | the target does both. They **Raise the Alarm** and then |

# Driving (Agility)

Domains: Speed, Slam, Thrill

The Driving skill is used to operate land vehicles, like cars, trucks,
and motorcycles. This skill is typically used with your Agility score,
but the GM may call for it to be used with Intellect at times, such as
when you are faced with a complicated array of instruments, dials and
switches used to operate an advanced vehicle.

In this game, virtually all modern vehicles are self-piloting and
require very little input from their human operators. In fact, some
vehicles are designed to *only* work in a driverless capacity and do not
even support manual input. Operating a vehicle in self-driving mode does
not require the use of the Driving skill.

Most vehicles can be switched into a manual mode, which allows the
driver a greater level of control. If you are trained in Driving, you
are not required to roll for routine manual operations such as driving
across town, navigating heavy traffic, or traversing a busy street with
pedestrians. However, the GM should have you roll when you try to
perform a maneuver that is risky, dangerous, or narratively important.

## Driving Skill Actions

There are six Driving skill actions:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Skill Action     Domain        Description
  ---------------- ------------- -----------------------------------------
  Chase            Speed         Catch up to and possibly overtake another
                                 vehicle

  Evade and Escape Speed         Drive faster and use evasive maneuvers to
                                 escape

  Pit Maneuver     Slam          Strike another vehicle and cause it to
                                 spin out

  Sideswipe        Slam          Force another vehicle to alter its course

  Precision        Thrill        Perform incredible and dangerous
  Driving                        maneuvers

  Vehicle Transfer Thrill        Move alongside and jump to another
                                 vehicle
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chase

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a vehicle*                 | *Difficulty Level: target           |
|                                     | vehicle\'s speed*                   |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Cost: 1 AP*                        | *Domain: Speed*                     |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Visual\], \[Auditory\], \[2W+ Vehicle\], \[Two Hands\]*      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Chase, you can try to catch up to (and even overtake)
another vehicle ahead of you on the road.

Using Chase means driving faster than other vehicles around you.
Assuming the vehicle you're chasing doesn't want to be caught, you also
need to drive faster than it so you can catch up. The DL used for your
Chase roll is based on the speed of the vehicle you are chasing and is
modified by your vehicle's Acceleration.

If your vehicle's maximum speed is less than the speed of the target
vehicle, you cannot close the gap until circumstances change. The GM may
allow a Chase attempt if the target vehicle encounters resistance, such
as heavy traffic, road construction, or mil-sec patrols, that forces
them to slow down and gives you a chance to close the gap.

If you use Chase with \[One Hand\], raise the DL by one.

|            | - If you choose to **Take the Lead**, overtake the      |
|            |   target vehicle. You are now directly in front of the  |
|            |   vehicle you were chasing.                             |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you decide to **Bump and Grind**, you can          |
|            |   immediately execute a Pit Maneuver.                   |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | You lose ground. You are slowed by other vehicles,      |
|            | pedestrians, or detritus in the road. You can still see |
|            | the vehicle you are chasing.                            |
|            |                                                         |

|            | - If you choose to **Go Off Road**, you drive where     |
|            |   you're not intended to drive, such as a sidewalk, a   |
|            |   grassy median, or a construction zone. Immediately    |
|            |   make a basic Agility roll. Use the DL you used for    |

|            |   - If you fail on your basic Agility roll, treat your  |
|            |     Chase roll as a critical failure.                   |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you decide to **Wait for an Opening**, you bide    |
|            |   your time. You can use Chase again next turn with a   |
|            |   DL lowered by one.                                    |

Evade and Escape is used to outrun one or more vehicles that are chasing
you.

When you use Evade and Escape, you dramatically increase your speed to
put as much distance between you and your pursuers. The Difficulty Level
for your roll is based on how fast you are willing to go and is modified
by your vehicle's Acceleration.

If you use Evade and Escape with \[One Hand\], raise the DL by one.

| Success    | You accelerate, putting significant distance between    |
|            | your vehicle and the ones chasing you. You break direct |

|            | **Stress:** At the end of your turn, the GM makes a     |
|            | Chase roll for the pursuers to see if they can catch up |
|            | to you. Your speed determines the base DL of the GM's   |

| Failure    | You are unable to put distance between your vehicle and |
|            | your pursuers, and they maintain their position         |

|            | - If you decide to **Perform Evasive Maneuvers**, you   |
|            |   take the chase down side streets and alleyways, drive |
|            |   across grassy spaces, and generally try to make it as |
|            |   hard as possible for the vehicles behind you to stay  |
|            |   on your tail. Make a basic Agility roll using your    |
|            |   speed to determine the DL.                            |
|            |                                                         |

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Visual\], \[Auditory\], \[4W+ Vehicle\], \[Two Hands\]*      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Pit Maneuver, you maneuver your vehicle alongside the
target vehicle, so that the front of your vehicle is lined up with the
rear end of the target vehicle. Then, you use your vehicle to strike the
rear quarter panel of the target vehicle with the intent of causing it
to spin out and for the other driver to lose control.

The DL for this skill action is based on the target vehicle's Stability
and is modified by your vehicle's Handling.

If you use Pit Maneuver with \[One Hand\], raise the DL by one.

| Success    | The target vehicle spins out when you smash into its    |
|            | rear quarter panel. It rapidly decelerates and comes to |
|            | a stop. Both your vehicle and the target vehicle        |
|            | sustain \[Minor Damage\].                               |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As success, but when you make contact with the target   |
| Success    | vehicle, you sense a great deal of leverage in your     |
|            | position.                                               |

|            | - If you choose to **Immobilize with Grace**, you       |
|            |   gently bump the target vehicle, sending into a        |
|            |   spinout. The other driver loses control, and their    |
|            |   vehicle rapidly decelerates and comes to a stop.      |
|            |   Neither vehicle sustains damage.                      |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you decide to **Ruin Their Day**, you slam into    |
|            |   the other vehicle, forcing it to careen wildly before |
|            |   it turns and flips in a terrible crash. Your vehicle  |
|            |   sustains \[Minor Damage\] and the target vehicle      |
|            |   takes \[Extreme Damage\].                             |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | You fail to properly execute Pit Maneuver, but you      |
|            | remain in position behind the target vehicle.           |

|            | You may attempt Pit Maneuver again next turn. However,  |
|            | if you fail a second time, the target vehicle will      |
|            | exploit your failure to put distance between you.       |
|            | You'll need to use Chase to catch up if you want to     |
|            | continue the pursuit.                                   |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | The other driver anticipates your Pit Maneuver and uses |
| Failure    | the opportunity to put distance between the two of you. |
|            |                                                         |
|            | Next turn, you must use Chase to catch up (unless you   |
|            | choose to abandon the pursuit).                         |

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Visual\], \[Auditory\], \[4W+ Vehicle\], \[Two Hands\]*      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Sideswipe is used to force another vehicle to alter its course. It is
often used to make a vehicle veer in a way that is highly undesirable to
its driver.

When you use Sideswipe, you intentionally swerve into the target vehicle
driving beside you. By using your car to unbalance the other driver, you
can force the target vehicle off the road, into oncoming traffic, or
into an obstacle, like a cement pylon, parked car, or lamp post.

The DL for this skill action is based on the target vehicle's Stability
and is modified by your vehicle's Handling.

If you use Sideswipe with \[One Hand\], raise the DL by one.

+============+:========================================================+
| Success    | Your vehicle smashes into the side of the target        |
|            | vehicle, causing it to veer off course. Both your       |
|            | vehicle and the target vehicle sustain \[Minor          |
|            | Damage\].                                               |

|            | If this is your first successful Sideswipe this turn,   |
|            | you have the upper hand. If you make another successful |
|            | Sideswipe this turn, you will force the target vehicle  |
|            | off the road.                                           |

|            | **Choice:** If this is your second successful Sideswipe |
|            | against the same target vehicle this turn, you can      |
|            | choose **Get Off the Road!** or **Twisted Metal**.      |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose **Get Off the Road!** you slam into the |
|            |   target vehicle, forcing it off the road. This action  |
|            |   does not force the target vehicle to come to stop,    |
|            |   but it does cause rapid deceleration and requires the |
|            |   driver to recover if they want to return to the road. |
|            |   Some situations may result in the target vehicle      |
|            |   taking additional damage or becoming undrivable, such |
|            |   as forcing the target vehicle into a swimming pool    |
|            |   (GM's discretion).                                    |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose **Twisted Metal**, you slam into the    |
|            |   target vehicle, forcing it to veer head long into an  |
|            |   unmoving, roadside obstacle, such as a lamp post, a   |
|            |   concreate pylon, or a parked car. The target vehicle  |
|            |   takes \[Severe Damage\] from the collision.           |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

|            |     attached to the other vehicle. You lose any unspent |
|            |     AP this turn. Your turn ends. At the beginning of   |
|            |     your next turn, your vehicles decouple, and you     |
|            |     return to your previous position, next to the       |

|            | - If the GM chooses **Watch Where You're Driving!**     |
|            |   your vehicle bounces off the target vehicle with      |
|            |   unexpected force, causing it to drift into a          |
|            |   hazardous area, such as oncoming traffic or a         |

|            |     vehicle takes \[Moderate Damage\] as you swerve and |
|            |     try to avoid obstacles in your way. You lose any    |

Precision Driving is used to perform incredible feats with your vehicle.
The GM will call on you to roll Precision Driving when you pull off a
challenging or risky maneuver.

When you use Precision Driving, you push your vehicle to the limit and
test your skill through a dramatic situation, whether by your own design
or forced upon you by the road. For example, when you round the corner
during a Chase and discover the only path forward is through a narrow
alleyway or across an open drawbridge, Precision Driving is used to see
how you handle that dramatic situation. On the other hand, you might
intentionally decide to take your vehicle down a large, stone staircase
to separate yourself from your pursuers and then follow it up by using
Evade and Escape.

The DL for this skill action is based on the driving maneuver and is
modified by your vehicle's Handling. The chart below provides examples.

If you use Precision Driving with \[One Hand\], raise the DL by one.

|            | - A critical failure is treated as a failure.           |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | You fail to properly execute the maneuver and suffer a  |
|            | consequence.                                            |
|            |                                                         |
|            | **Choice:** The GM can choose **Rock and a Hard Place** |
|            | or **Hang on Tight**.                                   |

|            | - If the GM chooses **Rock and a Hard Place**, your     |
|            |   vehicle gets stuck. How exactly it is stuck is up to  |
|            |   the GM, but the description should follow the action. |
|            |   if possible. For example, you tried to squeeze down a |
|            |   tight alleyway and got stuck there, or you attempted  |
|            |   to drive off road and got stuck in the mud. Your      |
|            |   vehicle comes to a stop. You must immediately make a  |
|            |   basic Agility roll with the same DL you used for      |
|            |   Precision Driving.                                    |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you succeed, on your basic Agility roll, you can |
|            |     back your vehicle out of wherever it is stuck and   |
|            |     return to the road.                                 |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you fail on your basic Agility roll, you are     |
|            |     really stuck. You may be able to exit your vehicle, |
|            |     but it\'s not going anywhere without the assistance |
|            |     of another vehicle like a tow truck.                |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If the GM chooses **Hang on Tight**, your vehicle     |
|            |   starts to spin out of control, which puts you at risk |
|            |   of having a collision. You must immediately make a    |
|            |   basic Agility roll with the same DL you used for      |
|            |   Precision Driving.                                    |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you succeed, on your basic Agility roll, you are |
|            |     able to regain control of your vehicle and avoid a  |
|            |     collision.                                          |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you fail on your basic Agility roll, you have a  |
|            |     collision with another vehicle or an environmental  |
|            |     element, such as a tree or lamp post. Your vehicle  |
|            |     takes \[Minor Damage\] and comes to a stop.         |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | You fail to execute the maneuver and suffer a major     |
| Failure    | consequence.                                            |
|            |                                                         |
|            | **Choice:** You can choose to **Bail Out** or **Close   |
|            | Your Eyes and Pray**.                                   |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose to **Bail Out**, you can see clearly    |
|            |   that a calamitous situation lies before you on the    |
|            |   road ahead. You slow down just enough to make your    |
|            |   jump survivable, and then you bail out. Your vehicle  |
|            |   careens ahead, driverless, before sustaining          |
|            |   \[Extreme Damage\]. You must immediately make a basic |
|            |   Resilience roll to resolve this action.               |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you succeed on your basic Resilience roll, you   |
|            |     take 5 damage.                                      |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you fail on your basic Resilience roll, you take |
|            |     damage equal to the DL you used for this roll. For  |
|            |     example, if you failed your basic Resilience roll   |
|            |     with a DL of Hard (14), you would take 14 damage.   |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose to **Close Your Eyes and Pray**, you    |
|            |   put your character's fate in the GM's hands. The GM   |
|            |   may use this opportunity to narrate a spectacular     |
|            |   crash, an incredible and unexpected recovery, or      |
|            |   something in between. Your vehicle may suffer up to   |
|            |   \[Extreme Damage\] because of the events that unfold  |
|            |   (GM's discretion), but the GM should refrain from     |
|            |   unilaterally killing the character driving the        |
|            |   vehicle. If, for example, the vehicle somehow lands   |
|            |   in the water and begins to sink, the character        |
|            |   driving the vehicle should have the opportunity to    |
|            |   escape and swim to safety.                            |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Vehicle Transfer is used to steady your vehicle so someone can jump from
it to another vehicle you're driving next to. You can use this skill
action in cooperation with a passenger or by yourself.

When you use Vehicle Transfer, you start by pulling up alongside the
target vehicle and getting as close to it as possible. Then, either you
or your passenger prepares to jump by climbing out a window or a
sunroof, for example, or by standing up on the seat, if you happen to be
on a motorcycle.

- If you use Vehicle Transfer with a passenger and you are the one
  jumping, they take control of your vehicle as soon as you relinquish
  it. In this case, your passenger is the one who must make the Vehicle
  Transfer roll because they are responsible for keeping the vehicle
  steady. Otherwise, you remain the driver and make the Vehicle Transfer
  roll while your passenger jumps.

<!-- -->

- If you perform Vehicle Transfer by yourself (an exceedingly risky and
  dangerous activity, to say the least) then you must keep your vehicle
  steady while also climbing out the window and preparing to jump. You
  are encouraged to describe how you are attempting to accomplish this
  impressive feat.

The DL for this skill action is based on the speed of the target vehicle
and is modified by your vehicle's Handling.

If you are using Vehicle Transfer with \[One Hand\], raise the DL by
one.

If you are attempting Vehicle Transfer by yourself, raise the DL by one.

|            |                                                         |
|            | - If the person jumping fails on their basic Strength   |
|            |   roll, they slip.                                      |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If the d20 result (without adding an ability score) |
|            |     of the basic Strength roll was odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9,  |
|            |     11, 13, 15, 17, or 19), the person jumps and lands  |
|            |     on the target vehicle but they are barely holding   |
|            |     on and are at risk of falling.                      |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If the d20 result (without adding an ability score) |
|            |     was even (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20).   |
|            |     The person slips *before* jumping and is now        |
|            |     dangling precariously from your vehicle. They are   |
|            |     at risk of falling.                                 |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | Your use of precision and stability is a thing to       |
| Success    | behold. You move so close to the target vehicle that    |
|            | the person "jumping" merely needs to step onto the      |
|            | target vehicle and grab on. They still have to make a   |
|            | basic Strength roll, as described above, to execute the |
|            | transfer, but the DL is Automatic (2).                  |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | You fail to maintain effective pacing with the target   |
|            | vehicle. A jump is not possible at this time.           |
|            |                                                         |
|            | **Choice:** You can choose **Steady, Steady\...** or    |
|            | **Lose Your Lunch**.                                    |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose **Steady, Steady\...**, you try to      |
|            |   steady your vehicle and slowly move back into         |
|            |   position. You must immediately make a basic Agility   |
|            |   roll using the same DL you used for Vehicle Transfer. |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you succeed on your basic Agility roll, you      |
|            |     slowly drift toward the target vehicle. You may     |
|            |     attempt Vehicle Transfer again on your next turn.   |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you fail on your basic Agility roll, you get too |
|            |     close, and your vehicle lightly bounces off the     |
|            |     target vehicle. This incident is not significant    |
|            |     enough to cause the person jumping to fall, but it  |
|            |     does cause \[Minor Damage\] to both vehicles. You   |
|            |     may attempt Vehicle Transfer again on your next     |
|            |     turn.                                               |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose **Lose Your Lunch**, you first widen    |
|            |   the distance between your vehicles, and then          |
|            |   dramatically sweep towards the target vehicle, as if  |
|            |   to launch the person who is going to jump. You must   |
|            |   immediately make a basic Agility roll using the same  |
|            |   DL you used for Vehicle Transfer but raise the DL by  |
|            |   one.                                                  |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you succeed on your basic Agility roll, you      |
|            |     swing wide and then ricochet back with your         |
|            |     vehicle, serving up an opportunity for the person   |
|            |     who's jumping to make their move. Treat this        |
|            |     outcome as a Vehicle Transfer success.              |
|            |                                                         |
|            |   - If you fail on your basic Agility roll, you swing   |
|            |     wide and then come back with such force that you    |
|            |     slam, hard into the target vehicle. Treat this      |
|            |     outcome as a Vehicle Transfer critical failure.     |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | Disaster. Your vehicle collides with the target vehicle |
| Failure    | and both take \[Moderate Damage\]. Both vehicles spin   |
|            | out of control.                                         |
|            |                                                         |
|            | The person driving must immediately make a basic        |
|            | Agility roll using the same DL as Vehicle Transfer but  |
|            | raise the DL by one.                                    |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you succeed on your basic Agility roll, you manage |
|            |   to bring your vehicle to a controlled stop without    |
|            |   incurring additional damage.                          |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you fail on your basic Agility roll, your vehicle  |
|            |   ping pongs between other vehicles and roadside        |
|            |   obstacles before finally coming to a sudden stop as   |
|            |   it completes its final collision and takes \[Extreme  |
|            |   Damage\].                                             |
|            |                                                         |
|            | In either case, if you had a passenger who was prepared |
|            | to jump, they are thrown from the vehicle and take      |
|            | damage equal to the DL of your basic Agility roll. For  |
|            | example, if the DL for your basic Agility roll was      |
|            | Severe (18), then they take 18 damage.                  |

### Vehicle Transfer

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Cost: 2 AP\                                  Domain: Thrill
  Difficulty Level: Varies, See chart below    
  -------------------------------------------- --------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirement: You must be driving alongside another vehicle. You must
have a passenger.

When you use Vehicle Transfer, you move as close as possible to the
target vehicle, which must be driving beside you. Then, either you or
your passenger climbs out through a window (or stands up on a
motorcycle) before leaping onto the target vehicle. If you are the one
jumping, your passenger takes control of your vehicle as soon as you let
go. The Difficulty Level of Vehicle Transfer is based on the speed of
the target vehicle. Whoever is jumping (you or your passenger) must make
an Athletics roll separately to determine that outcome. The Difficulty
Level for the Athletics roll is the same as the one you used for Vehicle
Transfer.

*Results*

- **Success** -- Good communication with your passenger and excellent
  driving skill allows you to get close enough to the target vehicle
  that either you can let your passenger take over driving or allow them
  to jump. Whoever is jumping (you or your passenger) should now make an
  Athletics roll with the same Difficulty Level you used for Vehicle
  Transfer.

  - **Critical Success** -- As success, but you position your vehicle
    perfectly, making the jump to the target vehicle much easier.
    Whoever is jumping (you or your passenger) gains a +2 bonus to their
    Athletics roll.

- **Failure** -- You are unable to effectively maintain a suitable
  position with your vehicle, you fail to properly communicate with your
  passenger, or environmental conditions are too challenging. Regardless
  of the specifics, you fail to executive Vehicle Transfer. Your vehicle
  remains in the same position relative to the target vehicle, and you
  can attempt Vehicle Transfer again.

  - **Critical Failure** -- Your attempt to executive a Vehicle Transfer
    results in disaster. Your vehicle collides with the target vehicle
    and both take \[minor damage\]. The person who is jumping (you or
    your passenger) is immediately thrown into peril and must make an
    Athletics roll with a Difficulty Level of Hard (14) to avoid
    falling. See the **Falling from a Moving Vehicle** sidebar.

## Computer (Intellect)

Domains: Exploit, Data Flow, Control

The Computer skill represents your ability to use and understand
computer systems, networks, and other, related technologies, like
robotics and cybernetics. This skill is typically used with Intellect.

In this game, virtually every aspect of life involves technology and
computers in one form or another. Operating a computer to perform
everyday tasks like ordering food, making an appointment, and searching
for information, do not require the use of the Computer skill.

This skill allows you to hack into local devices so you can immediately
take control of them, as well as remote systems which might contain
caches of pay data or important clues to help you solve a current
problem, or which might be connected to remote devices that you want to
exploit.

## Computer Skill Actions

There are six Computer skill actions:

| The Net (or, more commonly, *the Net*) is the worldwide, global       |
| network that connects nearly all systems and devices. It is the       |
| backbone of modern, digital infrastructure in the world of the game.  |

| A system is any number of devices, computers, and databases connected |
| through a digital network. Systems can also be nested inside of       |
| larger systems. For example, a local fast food joint will have its    |
| own system, as will each restaurant in that chain. All those          |
| individual systems are part of the larger, regional, corporate        |
| system, which may then be part of an even larger, worldwide,          |
| corporate system. Thus, it may be necessary to perform a hacking      |
| routine multiple times before it is possible to reach the final       |
| target.                                                               |

| Intrusion Countermeasures (IC), also referred to as *bots*, are       |

| have whole battalions of bots to patrol their digital borders. Some   |
| systems are protected by advanced IC on the inside, as well, though   |
| it is impossible to assess this threat without first gaining system   |
| access.                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| ### System Access                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| System access means you have basic privileges to browse the system    |
| and access data that is generally available to all users. As a        |
| hacker, it is necessary to gain system access via cyberspace before   |
| attempting to elevate privileges, which are needed to access to       |
| restricted data and devices.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| ### Roles and Privileges                                              |
|                                                                       |
| In this game, all systems support three roles: User, Power User, and  |
| Admin. These roles define a set of privileges, which determines what  |
| a person in that role can and cannot do in the system.                |
|                                                                       |
| - User Role -- Basic privileges; can access data that is widely       |
|   available to system users; can view only low risk devices attached  |
|   to the system                                                       |
|                                                                       |
| - Power User -- Elevated privileges; can access restricted data; can  |
|   view and control low-medium risk devices attached to the system;    |
|   cannot delete or recover data; cannot shut down the system or its   |
|   attached components                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| - Admin User -- Maximum privileges; can access all data; can view and |
|   access all computers and devices attached to the system; can delete |
|   and recover data; can shut down the system and its attached         |
|   components                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| ### Datajacks                                                         |
|                                                                       |
| Dedicated hackers often choose to enhance their skills with a direct  |
| neural interface (DNI), more commonly known as a *datajack*. This     |
| cybernetic implant is connected to the brain stem and is typically    |
| installed behind their ear or on the cusp of the neck. Despite        |
| datajacks being a requirement for most hackers, the implant was       |
| originally developed for other use cases and is common enough that    |
| having one does not arouse suspicion or automatically label someone   |
| as a hacker.                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| ### Cyber Rigs                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| A datajack must be connected to a *cyber rig*, a specialized,         |
| portable computer designed to take advantage of a direct neural       |
| interface. Developed by and for hackers, cyber rigs are illegal in    |
| most countries because their sole purpose is to facilitate hacking.   |
| Without a datajack and a cyber rig, a hacker is just another user.    |
|                                                                       |
| ### Jacking In                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| When a hacker connects a cable from their rig to their datajack, it   |
| is called *jacking in*. This action transforms their thoughts into    |
| pure data, an experience which users frequently describe as           |
| disembodying. It feels as if one's consciousness has detached from    |
| their body, allowing them to directly and intuitively interact with   |
| data flows and to seek out remote systems in cyberspace.              |
|                                                                       |
| ### Cyberspace                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| Whereas regular people access the Net every day, a hacker that jacks  |
| in using a cyber rig enters *cyberspace*. Technically indistinct from |
| the Net, cyberspace is the shared hallucination hackers experience    |
| when transforming their thoughts into pure data by way of a dedicated |
| neural interface. It is through cyberspace that a hacker "sees" a     |
| firewall or "travels" to a remote system. Not strictly programmed to  |
| exist, cyberspace is an emergent phenomenon that only hackers can     |
| experience.                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| ### Hardline                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| When a cyber rig is connected to a wired port in the wall, it is said |
| to be using a *hardline*. Using a hardline has many advantages as     |
| compared to wireless, and it is the preferred connection method for   |
| any hacker who intends to engage in a deep dive. It offers vastly     |
| higher bandwidth, something that is needed for DNI transfers, lower   |
| latency, greater reliability, and significantly enhanced security     |
| against interception and tracing. When your life is on the line       |
| because you are battling against Black IC, you want a hardline.       |
|                                                                       |
| ### Wireless                                                          |
|                                                                       |
| Wireless is ubiquitous, and it is the way most people interact with   |
| the Net. Virtually all devices, including cyber rigs, are designed to |
| leverage wireless connections. Even most cybernetic implants connect  |
| wirelessly and are always online so they can receive updates from     |
| their manufacturers. It is possible, and sometimes even desirable, to |
| engage in hacking over wireless, though most hackers prefer a         |
| hardline when performing a deep dive into a system.                   |
|                                                                       |
| ### AR Mode                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| Instead of jacking in and entering cyberspace, a hacker can put their |
| cyber rig into augmented reality (AR) mode, which allows them to      |
| engage in on-the-fly hacks. When a cyber rig enters AR mode, it       |
| wirelessly communicates with the hacker's datajack to spin up a set   |
| of augmented reality (AR) overlays in their field of view. Viable     |
| targets, including devices connected to the Net, and even people's    |
| cybernetic implants, are highlighted for easy discernment. Using the  |
| rig's keyboard, the hacker can tab through the targets or directly    |
| select one to hack.                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| ### Devices                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| In this game, *device* is a broad term used to describe any computer, |
| peripheral, or piece of technology attached to a system. Some         |
| examples of devices include laptops, tablets, consoles, phones,       |
| security cameras, electronic locks, streetlights, stoplights, digital |
| billboards, menu kiosks, and so on. The overwhelming majority of      |
| devices are wireless and attached to their respective systems. It is  |
| very rare to find a standalone device that is not capable of wireless |
| connectivity.                                                         |

Requirement: You have located the target system in cyberspace.

When you use Penetrate Firewall, you attempt to gain unauthorized access
to a system by exploiting flaws in its firewall. To do this, you observe
the firewall, which appears as a fractal-like pattern of spinning code,
searching for flaws to exploit.

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+

*Results*

- **Success** -- By observing the firewall's code as it streams past you
  in cyberspace, you identify a flaw and effortlessly execute a command
  to exploit it. The firewall opens, granting you system access.

  - **Critical Success** -- As success, but you find a backdoor. In the
    future, you can automatically use Penetrate Firewall to bypass this
    system's firewall without needing to roll, as normal. However, each
    time you try to use the backdoor, roll a d20, and on a result of a
    1, you discover that the backdoor has been patched by the system
    administrators and is no longer available.

- **Failure** -- You are unable to identify any flaws to exploit, the
  firewall code patterns were too unpredictable, or the command syntax
  was too challenging. Regardless of the specifics, you fail to gain
  access to the system. If this was your first failed attempt at
  Penetrate Firewall during this hacking routine, no alerts have been
  triggered, and you may try using Penetrate Firewall again. If this was
  your second failed attempt, you trigger a system alert. You can
  immediately jack out to abandon the hack. Otherwise, you have an IC
  Encounter with a perimeter defense bot.

  - **Critical Failure** -- As failure, but you immediately initiate an
    IC Encounter with a perimeter defense bot.

### System Override

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Difficulty Level: Architecture            \[Jacked In\], (\[Wired\] or
                                            \[Wireless\])\
                                            Domain: Exploit
  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirement: You have system access.

When you use System Override, you search for a weakness in the system's
code and structure and then try to exploit it so you can gain elevated
system privileges. Higher level privileges grant you the ability to
control devices attached to the system, as well as the power to delete
and recover data.

*Results*

- **Success** -- By searching through the system's innerworkings, you
  detect a flaw in the code and successfully execute a command to
  exploit it. If this was your first successful System Override during
  this hacking routine, you gain Power User privileges, and you may roll
  again to further elevate your access. If this was your second success,
  you gain Admin privileges.

  - **Critical Success** -- As success, but you discover a significant
    flaw in the system architecture. You gain Admin privileges, even if
    it was your first success.

- **Failure** -- You are unable to find a flaw in the system's code, the
  commands you try to use are deprecated and no longer function, or you
  suffer from unexpected spikes in latency, which make your attempt
  ineffective. Regardless of the specifics, you fail to elevate your
  privileges in the system, and your activities trigger an alert. If
  this was your first failure with System Override during this hacking
  routine, you can immediately jack out to abandon the hack or use Ghost
  Trace to try and suppress the alert. If you are successful with Ghost
  Trace, you may try System Override again. If this was your second
  failure with System Override, or if you failed with Ghost Trace, you
  immediately initiate an IC Encounter with an intrusion prevention bot.

  - **Critical Failure** -- As failure, but you immediately initiate an
    IC Encounter with an intrusion prevention bot. If the system is
    armed with a Black IC bot, it is deployed against you in the IC
    Encounter alongside the intrusion prevention bot.

### Manipulate Data

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Difficulty Level: Architecture             \[Jacked In\], (\[Wired\] or
                                             \[Wireless\])\
                                             Domain: Data Flow
  ------------------------------------------ ----------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirement: You have Power User or Admin privileges.

When you use Manipulate Data, you search the system for the information
you seek, and then you act on that data. You can be as broad or specific
as you want with your search. For example, you could ask for files that
include a specific person's name, for design plans related to a new
drone under development, or even for something as vague as, "anything
interesting," also known as *paydata*---data that contains information
about something that someone, usually a competitor, would pay good money
to acquire. Once you locate the data you want, you can save a copy for
yourself, modify its contents, delete the data, or recover the data,
depending on your current privileges.

*Results*

- **Success** -- Your search is successful, and you find the data you
  want. If you have Power User (or higher) privileges, you can modify
  its contents. You can also save a copy of the data (modified or
  unmodified) for yourself. If you have Admin privileges, you can also
  delete the data from the system.

  - **Critical Success** -- As success, but you also find a valuable
    cache of paydata. If you were already looking for paydata, its value
    is doubled.

- **Failure** -- You have difficulty finding the data you want. The
  system is not well indexed, has an archaic search mechanism, or has a
  poorly implemented localization feature. Regardless of the specifics,
  you do not find the data you were after. You can try to use Manipulate
  Data again.

  - **Critical Failure** -- As failure, but your activities also trigger
    an alert. You made a monumental mistake while poking around in the
    system, the nature of your searches raised too many red flags, or
    the frequency of your searches reached a certain threshold.
    Regardless of the specifics, an alert has been triggered, and you
    have two options. You can immediately jack out to abandon the hack
    or use Ghost Trace to try and suppress the alert. If you are
    successful with Ghost Trace, you may try Manipulate Data again. If
    you fail with Ghost Trace, you immediately initiate an IC Encounter
    with an intrusion prevention bot.

### Ghost Trace

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Difficulty Level: Security                 \[Jacked In\], (\[Wired\] or
                                             \[Wireless\]\
                                             Domain: Data Flow
  ------------------------------------------ ----------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirement: You are in cyberspace. To suppress alerts, you must have
system access.

Ghost Trace can be used in two very different ways. First, if you are
not currently inside a system, you can observe data as it flows past you
through cyberspace and then run Ghost Trace to try and find a target
system's address. (If you already have the target system's address, it
is unnecessary to use Ghost Trace to find it.) When you use Ghost Trace
to find a system, you must name or describe it. For example, "I want to
find the San Bernadino Valley High School system," or "I want to find a
system for one of the local banks." Second, if you already have system
access and trigger an alert, you can try to run Ghost Trace to suppress
it. In both cases, the system's Security rating is used as the
Difficulty Level.

*Results*

- **Success** -- If you used Ghost Trace to find a system, you gain the
  system's address and locate it in cyberspace. If you used Ghost Trace
  to suppress an alert, you successfully silence it and may try using
  the skill action that triggered it again. You may spend 1 AP every
  round to continue suppressing the alert without needing to roll. Your
  actions can still trigger a new alert.

  - **Critical Success** -- As success, but if you used Ghost Trace to
    find a system, your observation of the data flow also reveals a
    weakness you can exploit. You gain a +1 bonus to Penetrate Firewall
    rolls during this hacking routine. If you used Ghost Trace to
    suppress an alert, it is so effective that the alert is completely
    disabled, and you need not spend AP each round. Your actions can
    still trigger a new alert.

- **Failure** -- If you used Ghost Trace to try and find a system, the
  data flow was too hard to follow, packet divergence caused the data
  flow to splinter and you lost the trail, or you ended up following a
  false data flow without realizing it. Regardless of the specifics, you
  do not gain the target system's address and not locate it in
  cyberspace, but you may try again. If you used Ghost Trace to try and
  suppress an alert, you fail to do so and initiate an IC Encounter, as
  described in the skill action that triggered it.

  - **Critical Failure** -- If you used Ghost Trace to try and find a
    system, you also inadvertently leave a data trail bearing your
    signature. If you used Ghost Trace to try and suppress an alert, you
    also inadvertently expose your signature to the system you are in.
    In either case, the Difficulty Level for Ghost Trace is raised by
    one for the duration of this hacking routine.

### Street Hack

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Cost: 1 AP\                                  \[Wireless\]\
  Difficulty Level: Varies, See chart below    Domain: Control
  -------------------------------------------- --------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirement: You have line of sight to the target device.

When you use Street Hack, your cyber rig wirelessly communicates with
your data jack to create an AR overlay that allows you to select the
target device in your field of view.

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+

*Results*

- **Success** -- You execute an attack against the target device and
  successfully gain access, bringing it under your direct control. You
  can use the features and functions of the device, and you have access
  to data stored on it. For example, if the device is a security camera,
  you can see what it sees, access recent video still stored on the
  device, shut it down, or restart it.

  - **Critical Success** -- As success, but your hack also reveals a
    critical weakness in the system to which the device is attached. If
    you decide to jack in and start a hacking routine on this system,
    you gain a +1 on rolls to use Penetrate Firewall.

- **Failure** -- There is too much wireless interference in the area,
  the protocols in your cyber rig are unable to get a foothold in the
  device, or the device is so old that it keeps dropping your
  connection. Regardless of the specifics, you fail to gain access, but
  you can try to use Street Hack again on this device.

  - **Critical Failure** -- As failure, but you also inadvertently trip
    an alert, causing the device to fall back into safe mode. You cannot
    attempt to use Street Hack on this device for 1 hour, after which
    time the device resets itself. Depending on who owns the device, a
    security team may also be on their way to investigate.

| ### Jackless Hacks                                                    |

| It is possible to perform rudimentary hacks without a cyber rig and   |
| datajack. Basic tech like portable computers can be modified with     |
| illegal chips that enable their operators to use Street Hack.         |
|                                                                       |
| When you use Street Hack without a cyber rig and datajack, change the |
| cost to 3 AP and raise the DL by one. Also, you cannot critically     |
| succeed. If you get a critical success on Street Hack, treat it as a  |
| success, instead.                                                     |

| It is not uncommon for jackless hacking to act as a gateway to 'real' |
| hacking. The thrill of hacking devices is insatiable for some and     |
| ultimately leads to the acquisition of a cyber rig and the            |
| installation of a datajack.                                           |

  Difficulty Level: Varies, See chart below    Domain: Control
  -------------------------------------------- --------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirement: You have line of sight to the target person or animal.

When you use Hack Cybernetics, you select one of the targets highlighted
by your AR overlay and inspect it. Inspecting a target reveals its
wireless-enabled cybernetic implants. You select one implant as the
target of your hack.

|                     | Tightly restricted, military quality           |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+

*Results*

- **Success** -- You successfully execute an attack on the target
  implant. If this was your first successful use of Hack Cybernetics on
  the target implant, you gain direct control of it. You can make the
  implant shut down, or you can force it to perform its core function.
  If the implant can operate in different modes, you can change the
  mode. If the implant stores data, you can access, copy, modify, or
  delete its data. If this was your second success on the target, you
  gain access to its low-level settings, allowing you to make the
  cybernetic implant to glitch and malfunction. The target suffers a --1
  penalty to all rolls while one of its cybernetic implants is
  glitching.

  - **Critical Success** -- As success, but you gain access to low level
    settings and can cause the implant to glitch, even if it's your
    first successful use of Hack Cybernetics.

- **Failure** -- There is too much wireless interference, the target
  implant is running a proprietary instruct set that you were not
  expecting, or the implant is of such low quality that it keeps
  dropping your connection. Regardless of the specifics, you fail to
  gain access, but you can try to use Hack Cybernetics again on this
  implant.

  - **Critical Failure** -- As failure, but your attempt causes a
    split-second glitch in the implant, not enough to warrant a penalty
    to the implant's owner, but enough that they are aware that
    something odd just happened. Anyone whose been in the life long
    enough to survive will recognize that glitch for what it is: a
    hacker trying to boost their 'ware. And they will react accordingly,
    which usually means disabling wireless on all their implants as a
    first step (GM's discretion).

# Culture (Intellect)

Domains: Power, Corruption, Survival

The Culture skill represents your knowledge and understanding of various
subcultures in the game world. Unlike other skills, Culture has only one
skill action, which applies to each of the six subcultures covered by
this skill.

The Culture skill is always used with Intellect.

## Subcultures

There are six subcultures covered by the Culture skill:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Subculture          Domain       Description
  ------------------- ------------ ----------------------------------------
  Corporate           Power        Corporations, hierarchies, key players

  Mil-Sec             Power        Military procedures, resources,
                                   capabilities

  Politics            Corruption   Bureaucracy, government, backroom deals

  Organized Crime     Corruption   Syndicates (Mafia, Triad, Yakuza), key
                                   people

  Gangs               Survival     Territory, colors, symbols, slang,
                                   operations

  Street              Survival     Drugs, prostitution, safe places,
                                   panhandling
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Domains

The domains shown above (Power, Corruption, and Survival) are associated
with subcultures rather than with skill actions. When you use the
Cultural Knowledge skill action, described below, it takes on the domain
associated with the subculture used for the roll.

In other words, if you use Cultural Knowledge (Gangs) to identify the
name of a game based on its symbol and colors, the skill action uses the
Survival domain. If you used the skill action in the context of a
Corporate subject, it would take on the Power domain.

The single skill action for the Culture skill is called Cultural
Knowledge.

When you use Cultural Knowledge, you recognize, recall, or relate
information about a subject within the scope of a particular subculture.
This skill action requires you to pose a question to the GM who will
then identify the appropriate subculture before you roll. The question
should generally start with "Does my character know\..." or "Do I
know\..."

For example, a character sees a group of bikers wearing black leather
jackets with a red devil emblazoned on the back. The player asks the GM,
"Does my character know what gang that is?" The GM tells the player to
make a Cultural Knowledge (Gangs) roll. Consulting the Difficulty Level
chart below, the GM decides this is common knowledge and tells the
player to use a DL of Easy (6).

# Medicine (Intellect)

Domains: Analysis, Treatment, Invasive

The Medicine skill represents your understanding of human biology,
including organs and internal systems, injuries, sickness, and death, as
well as the ability to put your medical knowledge into practice. From
quick patch-ups on the street to surgical procedures and cybertech
installations, the Medicine skill offers a broad range of skill actions.

The Medicine skill is almost always used with Intellect, but the GM may
call for it to be used with another ability, like Agility, when the task
is routine and time is of the essence, or Resilience, when the task is
more strenuous than it is mentally demanding, such as during a six-hour
surgical procedure.

## Medicine Skill Actions

There are six Medicine skill actions:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Skill Action         Domain      Description
  -------------------- ----------- ----------------------------------------
  Medical Examination  Analysis    Medically evaluate an injured person

  Forensic Examination Analysis    Forensically examine a dead body

  First Aid            Treatment   Stabilize and treat ailments and toxins

  Extended Care        Treatment   Monitor a patient's care to improve
                                   recovery time

  Surgery              Invasive    Perform a surgical procedure to treat an
                                   injury

  Cybernetic           Invasive    Integrate cybernetics into a living body
  Installation

Medical Examination is used to evaluate a target's injuries.

If you use Medical Examination without the proper \[Tools\], raise the
DL by one.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Difficulty Level                   Injury Severity

| Success    | Your examination reveals important information about    |
|            | the target's injury. The next time you use Surgery or   |
|            | Cybernetic Installation on the target during this       |
|            | scene, lower the DL by one. This benefit is lost if the |

|            | next scene. Also, the benefit is not lost if the target |
|            | sustains further injury or takes additional damage.     |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | Your examination is inconclusive.                       |

|            |   target's blood and run it through a lab test, which   |
|            |   requires a proper \[Location\] or suitable            |
|            |   substitute, such as a Doc-in-a-Box. It takes 30       |
|            |   minutes to get the results, at which point, you gain  |
|            |   the benefit of a success.                             |

|            |   another Medication Examination roll and lower the DL  |
|            |   by one. If you fail, treat it as a critical failure.  |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | Not only is your examination inconclusive, but you      |
| Failure    | cause them to sustain a Minor injury. Roll a d20 and    |
|            | consult the Minor Injury Chart to determine the result. |
|            | When the target sustains an injury, they also gain      |
|            | \[Traumatized\].                                        |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Forensic Examination is used to investigate a dead body. Through careful
inspection and thoughtful observation, you can learn a great deal about
the manner and recency of a person's death.

If you use Forensic Examination without the proper \[Tools\], raise the
DL by one.

The GM may adjust the DL of Forensic Examination based on the relative
simplicity or complexity of the target body's medical status.

|            |   If you fail, treat it as a critical failure.          |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | Not only are you unable to improve the target's         |
| Failure    | condition, but you cause them to sustain a Minor        |
|            | injury. Roll a d20 and consult the Minor Injury Chart   |
|            | to determine the result. When the target sustains an    |
|            | injury, they also gain \[Traumatized\].                 |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When you use Extended Care, you supervise someone\'s recovery during a
period of Convalescence. Among your activities, you provide comfort,
change bandages, administer drugs, and monitor vitals. Convalescence
usually means the patient must rest for at least one day (24 hours) to
gain a benefit, with some injuries requiring even longer durations. With
your help, those timeframes can be shortened.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Difficulty Level                   Target's Health Level
  ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------
  Moderate (10)                      Wounded

  Hard (14)                          Severely Wounded

  Severe (18)                        Death's Door
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Result        Description
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  Success       The target gains the benefits of Convalescence after 12
                hours.

  Critical      As success, but if the target immediately enters another
  Success       period of Convalescence under your care, it also
                completes in 12 hours.

  Failure       Your medical supervision was insufficient to alter the
                target's recovery. The target gains the benefits of
                Convalesce after 24 hours.

  Critical      Not only are you unable to reduce recovery time, but the
  Failure       target's condition deteriorates. At the end of the
                24-hour period, the target drops one health level and
                gains no benefit from this Convalescence.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Surgery

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a person*                  | *Difficulty Level: by injury*       |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: minutes to hours*        | *Domain: Invasive*                  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Visual\], \[Two Hands\]. \[Supplies\], \[Location\]*         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Use Surgery to treat an injury. Depending on the nature of the injury,
you may be able to treat yourself, or you might have to have someone
else perform Surgery on you. The Difficulty Level for your roll is based
on the injury. See Sustaining an Injury for more information.

Some injuries are eligible for field surgery. When you perform field
surgery, you must have the necessary \[Supplies\]. Since you are
operating outside of a dedicated medical facility, the DL is raised by
two.

You cannot use Surgery on a target that is \[Traumatized\] or who is in
\[Critical Condition\]. If a target has the \[Traumatized\] or
\[Critical Condition\] conditions, they must be removed before Surgery
can be performed.

### Multiple Injuries

If the target has sustained multiple injuries, you may treat each of
them in succession. It does not matter the order you treat them in, and
if you successfully treat more than one, the required recovery time is
not cumulative.

Define recovery time using the longest period of Convalescence of all
the treated injuries. In other words, if two injuries are treated in
succession, and one injury has a 24-hour recovery period and the other
has a 48-hour recovery period, then spending 48 hours in Convalescence
results in both injuries being removed.

### Duration

The amount of time you must dedicate to performing the surgery is based
on the Injury Severity. If you perform multiple, consecutive surgeries
on the same target, their durations are cumulative. See the **Limits on
Duration of Surgery and Cybernetic Installation** sidebar.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Injury Severity                    Surgery Duration
  ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------
  Minor Injury                       30 minutes

  Moderate Injury                    1 hour

  Major Injury                       2 hours

  Severe Injury                      4 hours

  Extreme Injury                     8 hours
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Result     | Description                                             |
+============+=========================================================+
| Success    | The surgery is a success. If the target has another     |
|            | injury, you may immediately use Surgery again to treat  |
|            | that injury.                                            |
|            |                                                         |
|            | The target is stable but must immediately enter         |
|            | Convalescence and complete the required recovery        |
|            | period. If the Surgery was performed at a suitable      |
|            | \[Location\], this recovery period begins               |
|            | automatically.                                          |
|            |                                                         |
|            | **Stress:** If the target is unable to immediately      |
|            | enter Convalescence (due to field surgery, for          |
|            | example), the target must make a basic Resilience roll  |
|            | with a DL of Easy (6) at the start of each new scene.   |
|            | Failure means the target gains the \[Traumatized\]      |
|            | condition.                                              |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As success, but if the target is unable to immediately  |
| Success    | enter Convalescence, the basic Resilience roll required |
|            | by **Stress** has a DL of Automatic (2).                |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | The surgery did not have the desired result.            |
|            |                                                         |
|            | **Choice:** You can either **Do No Harm** or **Wipe     |
|            | Your Brow**.                                            |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose to **Do No Harm**, you back out of the  |
|            |   procedure as safely as possible without risking       |
|            |   further damage. Any prior uses of Surgery that were   |
|            |   successful remain that way, and the target            |
|            |   immediately enters a recovery period, as described    |
|            |   under Success, above.                                 |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose to **Wipe Your Brow**, you push on,     |
|            |   past this setback. Immediately make another Surgery   |
|            |   roll and raise the DL by one. If your roll results in |
|            |   a failure, treat it as a critical failure.            |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | Not only are you unable to repair the target's injury,  |
| Failure    | but you cause their condition to deteriorate. The       |
|            | target takes 10 damage. The target also gains           |
|            | \[Traumatized\], which forces you to end the procedure. |
|            | If the target starts a new scene with the               |
|            | \[Traumatized\] condition from this critical failure,   |
|            | the target gains \[Critical Condition\].                |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

| ## Limits on Duration of Surgery and Cybernetic Installation          |
|                                                                       |
| You remain an effective medical provider for a maximum number of      |
| hours equal to twice your Resilience. This maximum applies to both    |
| Surgery and Cybernetic Installation and the durations of both         |
| procedures on the same target are cumulative.                         |
|                                                                       |
| For example, a character with a Resilience of 4 can use Surgery and   |
| Cybernetic Installation in any combination, for up to 8 hours.        |
|                                                                       |
| If you attempt to perform Surgery or Cybernetic Installation beyond   |
| this maximum, you make Surgery and Cybernetic Installation rolls      |
| using Resilience instead of Intellect and raise the DL of all such    |
| procedures by one.                                                    |
+=======================================================================+

## 

## Cybernetic Installation

+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------:+
| *Target: a person*                  | *Difficulty Level: by Cyber Level*  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Duration: minutes to hours*        | *Domain: Invasive*                  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| *Keywords: \[Visual\], \[Two Hands\]. \[Supplies\], \[Location\]*         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Use Cybernetic Installation to install cybernetic implants. Depending on
the nature of the implant, you may be able to do it yourself, or you
might have to have someone else install it for you. The Difficulty Level
for your roll is based on the Cyber Level of the implant. See Cybernetic
Implants for more information.

Cybernetic Installation requires \[Supplies\] and \[Location\]. If these
requirements cannot be met, you cannot use this skill action.

You cannot use Cybernetic Installation on a target that is
\[Traumatized\] or who is in \[Critical Condition\]. If a target has the
\[Traumatized\] or \[Critical Condition\] conditions, they must be
removed before Cybernetic Installation can be performed.

### Unrelated Injuries

If the target is currently suffering from one or more injuries unrelated
to the cybernetic implant being installed, those injuries make it more
likely that the body will reject the implant. For each such injury, the
DL of your Cybernetic Installation roll is raised by one.

For example, if you perform Cybernetic Installation to install a
cybernetic eye on a character who has Lost an Eye and who *also* has a
Shattered Hand, the unrelated injury (Shattered Hand) raises the DL by
one.

### Multiple Implants

If the target wants multiple implants installed, you may install each of
them in succession. It does not matter the order you install them in.

### Duration

The amount of time you must dedicate to performing the installation is
based on the implant\'s Cyber Level. If you perform multiple,
consecutive installations on the same target, their durations are
cumulative. See the **Limits on Duration of Surgery and Cybernetic
Installation** sidebar.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Implant Cyber Level              Cybernetic Installation Duration
  -------------------------------- --------------------------------------
  Minor Implant                    15 minutes

  Moderate Implant                 30 minutes

  Major Implant                    1 hour

  Severe Implant                   2 hours

  Extreme Implant                  4 hours
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Result     | Description                                             |
+============+=========================================================+
| Success    | The installation is a success, and the cybernetic       |
|            | implant is immediately available to the target. No      |
|            | recovery time is needed, and the target need not enter  |
|            | Convalescence. If the target wants another implant      |
|            | installed, you may immediately use Cybernetic           |
|            | Installation again to install that implant.             |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | As success, but you are in the zone. If you use         |
| Success    | Cybernetic Installation again to install another        |
|            | implant in the same target, the DL is lowered by one.   |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Failure    | During the Cybernetic Installation, you encounter a     |
|            | complication.                                           |
|            |                                                         |
|            | **Choice:** You can choose either **Take Extra Time**   |
|            | or **Stay on Schedule**.                                |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose to **Take Extra Time**, you carefully   |
|            |   address the complication before proceeding. Make a    |
|            |   Surgery roll with the same DL you used for Cybernetic |
|            |   Installation. If you succeed, you finish installing   |
|            |   the implant. If you fail, the target gains \[Critical |
|            |   Condition\], and you are forced to end the procedure. |
|            |   The total duration for this installation is doubled.  |
|            |                                                         |
|            | - If you choose to **Stay on Schedule**, you quickly    |
|            |   bypass the complication. Make another Cybernetic      |
|            |   Installation roll and raise the DL by one. If you     |
|            |   succeed, you finish installing the implant in the     |
|            |   standard duration. If you fail, the target gains the  |
|            |   \[Traumatized\] condition and receives a new injury.  |
|            |   Roll a d20 and consult the Sustaining an Injury       |
|            |   section. You are forced to end the procedure.         |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Critical   | The target's body outright rejects the implant. The     |
| Failure    | target gains \[Critical Condition\] and immediately     |
|            | suffers \[Cardiac Trauma\]. See the Extreme Injury      |
|            | Chart for details. You are forced to end the Cybernetic |

# Combat

The rules described here form the foundation for combat resolution.

## Turns: Round Robin

The flow of combat follows the standard round robin order used
throughout gameplay. This means any given round can consist of a mix of
combat and non-combat turns, depending on where different player
characters are in the game world and what they are doing. The GM may
interject on any player's turn to facilitate the outcome. On the GM's
turn, the opposition gets to act.

## Action Points

On your turn, if you are in combat, you use Action Points (AP) to
interact with the game. You get 3 AP at the start of your turn. You
spend AP to perform simple actions and skill actions on your turn. Once
you have spent all 3 AP, your turn is over. Unspent AP is lost at the
end of your turn (though you will get 3 AP to spend at the start of your
next turn).

### Simple Actions in Combat

In addition to skill actions, you can take simple actions in combat.
Simple actions do not require a roll and happen automatically, though
you must be able to pay the AP cost.

Simple actions available in combat are shown below.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Simple Action      Cost        Description
  ------------------ ----------- -----------------------------------------
  Draw Weapon        1 AP        You draw your weapon

  Switch Firing Mode 1 AP        You switch your weapon to a different
                                 firing mode

  Resolve            1 AP        You clear the jam or reload your weapon
  Malfunction                    

  Aim                1 AP        You aim your weapon before firing; this
                                 lowers DL by one; you can stack this
                                 benefit up to two times

  Move               1 AP        You move through the combat area (see
                                 Movement for more details)

  Interact           1 AP        You interact with your environment; you
                                 open a door, pick up an object, flip a
                                 light switch, enter a security code, etc.

  Retrieve an Item   1 AP        You retrieve an item located on your
                                 person or in a carried or worn container,
                                 such as in a bag, backpack, pocket, or
                                 pouch

  Ready Shield       1 AP        You ready your shield and immediately
                                 gain \[Partial Cover\].

  Take Cover         1 AP        You move to a position and are
                                 immediately granted \[Full Cover\] or
                                 \[Partial cover\], depending on the
                                 environment and your preference

  Focus              1 AP        You clear your mind to prepare for an
                                 important action. When the next skill
                                 action you use this turn causes you to
                                 make a roll, you may reroll one time. If
                                 you reroll, you must take the new result.

  Short Conversation 1 AP        You can have a quick conversation with
                                 someone who is either close enough to
                                 hear you or who is on a call with you.
                                 This short conversation allows you to
                                 make a short statement or ask a question.
                                 Then the other person can respond. Last,
                                 you can make another short statement.

  A Couple Words     0 AP        You can say one or two words, either in
                                 person or over a call, at no cost.

  Look Around        0 AP        You quickly look around to identify
                                 threats and take note of any other

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Making an Attack

To make an attack, follow the steps below.

1.  Identify your target by announcing your intention to make an attack.

2.  State the skill action (Single Shot, Called Shot, etc.) you will use
    and its AP cost (1 AP, 2 AP, etc.).

3.  If you are using a weapon with a firing mode, state the firing mode
    you will use to make the attack. (If your weapon is not already in
    the right firing mode, you may spend 1 AP to change it.)

4.  State the base Difficulty Level of the skill action, such as
    Moderate (10).

5.  The GM (and player) layer on conditions, qualities and other
    modifiers that raise the Difficulty Level. If this causes the DL to
    go over Extreme (22), refer to the **Exceeding Extreme (22)**
    sidebar.

6.  The player (and GM) layer on modifiers that lower the Difficulty
    Level.

7.  The player and GM arrive at the adjusted Difficulty Level.

8.  The player rolls a d20 and adds the appropriate ability score to get
    the result.

9.  Compare the result to the adjusted Difficulty Level. If the result
    is equal to or greater than the Difficulty Level, the attack hits.
    If the result is lower than the DL, the attack misses.

10. If the attack hits, the player compares the result to the Damage
    Degree chart.

11. If the target is wearing armor, it reduces the damage degree by its
    value. This gives you the final damage degree.

12. The player then consults the weapon's damage array for the damage
    value.

13. The damage is then applied to the target. If the damage degree was
    reduced below minor, the target takes 1 damage.

## Ranges in Combat

The distance between you and the target is called *range*. There are
five ranges used in this game: touch, short, medium, long, and extreme.

*Touch* is a special range because it is always the same; if you're
close enough to touch the target, you're in touch range. This is
equivalent to being at point blank range.

The Equipment chapter, later in this book, provides stats for weapons.
Each weapon entry indicates its range values, which are expressed as
three numbers, separated by slashes. These numbers represent the
weapon's short, medium, and long ranges (in meters). Anything beyond
long range is considered extreme range.

For example, consider a pistol with a Range of 10/25/50. This means that
this pistol has a short range of 10 meters, a medium range of 25 meters,
and a long range of 50 meters. Anything beyond 50 meters is considered
extreme range; and if you were standing close enough to be able to touch
the target, you would be in touch range.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Range Difficulty Level
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
            Touch DL lowered by one

            Short Use the base DL of the skill action

           Medium DL raised by one

             Long DL raised by two

          Extreme DL raised by three
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Sample Weapon Ranges

While each specific weapon has its own stats for range, the GM is free
to use these broad categories as a guide.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Weapon Sample Ranges (in meters)
  -------------------------- --------------------------------------------
                      Pistol 10/25/50

                     Shotgun 15/30/40

                         SMG 50/100/150

               Assault Rifle 100/300/500

                Sniper Rifle 300/600/900
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Firearms and Heavy Weapons

Firearms and heavy weapons are subject to rules on firing modes and
weapon malfunctions.

### Firing Modes

All firearms and heavy weapons have at least one *firing mode*, which
dictates how many rounds are issued by the weapon when you pull the
trigger, as well as how it cycles a new round into the chamber. A
weapon's firing mode also directly affects its damage potential.

Some weapons have more than one firing mode, allowing you to switch from
one to another, such as from \[Semi-Auto\] to \[Burst Fire\]. It costs 1
AP to switch firing modes.

+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Firing    | Description                                              |
| Mode      |                                                          |
+==========:+==========================================================+
| Semi-Auto | When you pull the trigger, the weapon issues a single    |
|           | round or shell and automatically cycles a new round into |
|           | the chamber so it can be immediately fired again.        |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Burst     | When you pull the trigger, the weapon issues a           |
| Fire      | three-round burst and then automatically cycles three    |
|           | new rounds into the chamber so the weapon can            |
|           | immediately fire a three-round burst again.              |
|           |                                                          |
|           | \[Burst Fire\] works best with \[Two Hands\]. If you use |
|           | \[Burst Fire\] with only one hand, the DL is raised by   |
|           | one.                                                     |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Full Auto | When you pull the trigger, the weapon continuously       |
|           | issues rounds until the trigger is released or the       |
|           | weapon runs out of ammo.                                 |
|           |                                                          |
|           | When you use an \[Attack\] skill action with \[Full      |
|           | Auto\], you suffer a critical failure on a roll of a 1   |
|           | or a 2 (instead of just a 1), or by getting a result 10  |
|           | or more lower than the DL, as normal.                    |
|           |                                                          |
|           | When you use an \[Attack\] skill action with \[Full      |
|           | Auto\], unless you get a critical failure on your roll,  |
|           | if a target was behind \[Soft Cover\], that \[Soft       |
|           | Cover\] is destroyed.                                    |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Shoot/    | When you pull the trigger, the weapon issues a single    |
|           | round or shell.                                          |
| Reload    |                                                          |
|           | After firing, spend 1 AP to cycle the weapon so it can   |
|           | be fired again. The specific loading mechanism could be  |
|           | pump action, lever action, or bolt action.               |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------+

### Weapon Malfunction: Out of Ammo and Weapon Jams

In this game, ammunition is not tracked, and you do not need to plan
your reloads. Instead, when you get a critical failure on an \[Attack\]
roll, you suffer a \[Weapon Malfunction\].

#### Weapon Malfunction

When you get a \[Weapon Malfunction\], your weapon either runs out of
ammo or gets jammed. You cannot use the affected weapon again until you
spend 1 AP to clear the jam or reload the weapon. This happens
automatically, requiring no rolls or inventory maintenance on your part.

## Weapon Damage

When you use an \[Attack\] skill action and get a success or a critical
success, it means you hit the target(s) and deal damage.

Each weapon description has an entry called Damage, which is expressed
as an array of five numbers separated by slashes. This damage array
represents a continuum of damage degrees, from minor to deadly. These
are called degrees of damage, as shown below:

Damage Array Format: Minor / Moderate / Major / Severe / Deadly

Example Damage Array: 8/12/16/20/24

This example array shows a range from 8 and 24 points of damage.

### Weapon Firing Modes and Damage

When you use firearms and heave weapons to attack, the firing mode you
choose affects your damage potential. Weapons that have multiple firing
modes are displayed multiple times, once for each firing mode. Each
entry provides the damage array to use for that firing mode.

#### Example Firearms Damage Arrays

The chart below shows some example damage arrays. The AR-99 and Uzi Mark
IV are listed twice on the chart because they use a different damage
array based on the selected firing mode.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Weapon Name          Type        Firing Mode         Damage Array
  -------------------- ----------- ------------------- -------------------
  Remington Firewalker Revolver    Shoot/Reload        6/8/10/12/14

  AR-99                Assault     Semi Auto           6/10/14/18/20

  AR-99                Assault     Burst               10/16/22/28/34

  Uzi Mark IV          SMG         Semi Auto           4/8/12/16/20

  Uzi Mark IV          SMG         Burst               8/12/16/20/24
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Better Rolls Mean More Damage

Compare the result of your attack roll (the one that yielded a success
or critical success) to the Damage Degree chart below. Your result
determines which value in the damage array to use. The higher your roll,
the more damage you deal.

For example, when you made your attack earlier, you rolled an 8 and
added your Agility score of 3. That gave you a result of 11. Comparing
your 11 to the Damage Degree chart below, it puts you at Moderate. Using
the same damage array from above, 8/12/16/20/24, we see that the attack
dealt 12 damage.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll Result                  Damage Degree
  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  6                            Minor

  10                           Moderate

  14                           Major

  18                           Severe

  22 or higher                 Deadly
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Armor

Armor reduces the damage degree before it is applied. For example, if
you deal Moderate damage, but the target has Armor 1, the damage is
lowered to Minor. If damage drops below minor, you deal 1 damage,
minimum.

#### Dealing Damage

When you deal damage, it reduces the target\'s current hit points. For
example, if a person with 14 hp takes 8 damage, they are reduced to 6 hp
(14 -- 8).

#### Effects of Damage

When damage reduces your current hit points enough, you enter new health
levels. There are five health levels: Healthy, Wounded, Severely
Wounded, Death's Door, and Dying. Each health level, except Healthy, has
penalties associated with it. See Health Conditions for more
information.

# Treating Wounds and Injuries

Getting hurt is part of the job. This section provides rules for natural
healing and dealing with injuries. See also the Medicine skill, which is
used to facilitate healing and to resolve injuries.

## Natural Healing

In this game, recovery from wounds is faster than in real life thanks to
advanced pharmaceuticals and neurotechnology. Most medicines contain
nanites that accelerate cellular and tissue repair and promote rapid
recovery.

### Sleep

Sleeping recovers lost hit points.

- After 8 hours of sleep, you recover hit points equal to half your
  Resilience score (rounded down).

- If you are \[Wounded\], \[Severely Wounded\], or on \[Death's Door\],
  you may sleep for 16 hours (two 8-hour periods) to recover hit points
  equal to your Resilience score.

You may only benefit from sleep recovery once in a 24-hour period.

### Convalescence

Convalescence represents a full day's rest with minimal activity.
Convalescence includes sleep, and you cannot combine the effects of
sleep and convalescence in the same 24-hour period.

You cannot enter Convalescence if you are \[Traumatized\]. If you are
\[Traumatized\], this condition must be removed before you can enter or
resume Convalescence. If you have completed part of your recovery period
when you become \[Traumatized\], you may resume progress towards
completing that period once the \[Traumatized\] condition is removed.

For every 24 hours that you dedicate to convalescence, you move up one
health level.

- \[Death's Door\] to \[Severely Wounded\]

- \[Severely Wounded\] to \[Wounded\]

- \[Wounded\] to \[Healthy\]

When you move up a health level, your hit points are restored to the
minimum value for that level.

For example, consider a character with 32 max hit points, as shown
below.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
              Health Level Hit Points
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
                   Healthy 32 hp

                   Wounded 16 hp

          Severely Wounded 8 hp

              Death's Door 4 hp
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

If this character currently has 7 hp, they are \[Severely Wounded\].
After 24 hours of convalescence, they move up one health level up to
\[Wounded\] and their hit points are set to16 hp.

### Medicine Skill

The Medicine skill includes a skill action called Extended Care.

If you are under the supervision of someone providing Extended Care,
your recovery is faster than Convalescence alone. See the Medicine skill
for details.

## Doc in a Box

This cube-shaped, portable, metal box is roughly the size of a
basketball and is carried in with one hand using the grip at the top.
When activated (1 AP), the top opens into two halves, like a tackle box,
to reveal an array of instruments and connected devices. An automated
computer system prompts you to use its sensors so it can collect data
and make a diagnosis. Then, it provides you with step-by-step
instructions on treating wounds and tending to injuries. If the
patient's condition is dire, it can even guide you through the process
of field amputations and surgery.

If you use Doc in a Box while providing medical care to someone, The
Difficulty Level of your First Aid, Extended Care, and Surgery rolls are
lowered by one.

**Restock and Recharge:** When you use Doc in a Box in conjunction with
a First Aid, Extended Care, or Surgery roll, there is a good chance its
charge and supplies will be spent.

- **Even --** If your d20 roll (not including ability score) is an even
  number (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20), there is no effect.
  Doc in a Box can be used on another First Aid, Extended Care, or
  Surgery roll.

- **Odd --** If your d20 roll (not including ability score) is an odd
  number (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, or 19), then Doc in a Box goes
  into sleep mode. You cannot use this Doc in a Box again until you pay
  50 cred and spend one hour restocking and recharging the device.

# Sustaining an Injury

In this game, combat is dangerous, and its effects can be brutal. If you
take enough damage, it can result in an injury, an enduring effect which
might be easily resolved, could require surgery, or may even lead to
cybernetic replacement.

## Injury Roll

The first time you drop to Death's Door during a scene, roll a d20 and
consult the Injury Severity Chart below to determine if you sustain an
injury.

### Roll with +2

Some extra dangerous attacks available to the GM indicate that if the
attack drops a character to Death's Door and triggers an Injury roll,
the roll should be made with a +2. This +2 modifier applies to your roll
on the Injury Severity Chart, as well as your roll on a subsequent
Injury Chart.

### Injury Severity Chart

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll d20  Severity    Effect
  --------- ----------- -------------------------------------------------
   1 -- 5   None        You do not sustain an injury.

    6 - 9   Minor       You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Minor Injury
                        Chart.

   10 - 13  Moderate    You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Moderate
                        Injury Chart.

   14 -17   Major       You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Major Injury
                        Chart.

   18 -21   Severe      You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Severe
                        Injury Chart.

     22     Extreme     You are \[Traumatized\]. Roll on the Extreme
                        Injury Chart.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic Resilience Roll

If the result of your roll on the Injury Severity Chart was 6 or higher,
it means your character may have suffered a permanent injury. However,
it is still possible to avoid that outcome.

Make a basic Resilience roll with a Difficulty Level of Hard (14). If
you succeed, you lower the Severity of your injury by one.

For example, rolling an 11 on the Injury Severity Chart results in an
injury of Moderate Severity. If you then succeed on a basic Resilience
roll, you lower the Severity of the injury from Moderate to Minor.

If this reduces the Severity of the injury to None, then you do not
sustain an injury.

## Determining the Injury

If, after making a basic Resilience roll, you still sustain an injury
(Minor, Moderate, Major, Severe, or Extreme), roll on the appropriate
injury chart below. If you applied a +2 modifier when you rolled on the
Injury Severity Chart, you also apply a +2 modifier when you roll on the
appropriate injury chart below.

This chart includes a description of the injury, its mechanical effect
on your character, and the steps necessary for recovery. Medical science
in the world of the GHOSTBURN 2325 has made such astounding advances
that even the most critical of injuries can be treated so effectively
that patients are fully recovered in a week's time.

# New North America

The year is 2325.

![](media/image2.png){width="6.5in" height="4.25in"}

Spinebreak

About half of the land in what remains of North America is known as
Spinebreak. It borders the old Canadian border on the north, extends
down the western coast, and extends to the edge of a region that was
once known as the Great Plains. Spinebreak also push south to the old
Mexico-US border.

The Great Upheaval transformed the shape of the world, and Spinebreak is
no exception. The mountain range formerly known as the Rocky Mountains
was torn asunder, with the middle part being swallowed up by the Earth
itself. This gap in the mountains is now controlled by the Ceyenne
Citadel, which is perfectly positioned as the gateway to the West.

The terrain of Spinebreak is incredibly harsh, as rocky outcroppings
make travel difficult. The region is littered with naturally occurring
geysers that vent toxic gasses and boiling liquids up from Earth's
bowels, as the tectonic plates below the surface continue to slowly
grind into their new positions. This slow grind results in frequent, if
relatively minor, earthquakes in the region, a fact that is primarily
responsible for humans collectively deciding to avoid Spinebreak and
find a better place to live.

There is life in Spinebreak, however. Flora and fauna continue to
thrive, even under its harsh conditions, and some humans choose to
travel through or settle here for various reasons. Corporations still
value the minerals buried beneath the surface, and there are at least a
dozen mining operations in Spinebreak at any one time. Outlaws,
runaways, and others who want or need to leave their old lives behind
sometimes end up in Spinebreak too. It is one of the few places a person
can truly start over.

### Brokerock

Brokerock is the largest settlement in Spinebreak. Once known as Boise,
it now clings to the fractured western coast left behind by the Great
Upheaval. Little more than a shanty town, it's populated by a transient
mix of criminals lying low, victims with nowhere else to turn, and
corporate underlings sent to monitor or correct mining operations.
Still, a few long-term residents call Brokerock home, whether drawn by
its isolation or as a way to escape a world at war with itself.

## Phoenix Rise 

Against all odds, Phoenix Rise stands as a beacon of freedom and
high-tech accomplishments against a backdrop of the barren wastelands of
the Rocky Wastes.

## Desert of Salt 

The City of Salt Lake used to stand here. Now, the entire region is a
barren desert of salt. The region\'s transformation, which happened over
the course of a single year, is unexplained at this time. Mentions of a
connection with Cheyenne Citadel pop up every once in a while, on dark
intel channels.

## Cheyenne Citadel 

This city-state exists for and is protected by a military organization
that has its roots in the old United States. The old NORAD complex built
into the base of the Rocky Mountains is key to their operations. A
massive sprawl in its own right, Cheyenne Citadel has many sectors, all
of which are highly monitored and access to which is strictly
controlled.

height="2.6354166666666665in"}

## Deepcold 

Located in the northern part of the old U.S., Deepcold is not just cold
because of the naturally occurring climate. It\'s engineered that way
using good, ol' fashioned weather control. Rugged server farms,
semi-mobile racks that seek cooler climes, are monitored by data herders
who look out for stragglers and aim for 100% data integrity.

## Madchidet 

A portmanteau of Madison-Chicago-Detroit, Madchidet is referred to as
\"Mashee\" by the locals. \"Locals\" being a relative term. Madchidet is
bordered by the Great Lakes on the North and East. It borders the Frozen
Dark and the Breadboard and a little bit of Riverwrought on its West and
Southwest. And it opens in the Bay of (TBD) on the south.

## The Breadboard 

This flat expanse of grasslands is the heart of agriculture in New North
America. Farms dot the countryside along with their fields and
livestock. Simple folk they are, these people still make use of some mad
farming technology. And they have the ability to repair their own
tractors, even though they have to hack them to do it. Everyone does.

## Riverwrought 

A network of rivers and inlets, eddies and creeks, Riverwroght is a
spiderweb of water, and a rather large on at that. To the south,
Riverwrought borders Texnoplex. Riverwrought is responsible for cleaning
and distributing potable water to most civilized people in New North
America.

## Texnoplex 

Surprisingly small give its lineage, Texnoplex is a highly advanced,
ultra capitalist metroplex with a Texas flair. (I need to think about
this one more, I think.)

## Ridgeworld Sprawl 

A city of almost incomprehensible size, Ridgeworld Sprawl stands as a
testament to human ingenuity, engineering, and pride. It was the final
point of retreat, the place where humankind said to the oncoming water,
\"You shall rise no more.\" Built into the sides of the Appalachian
Mountains, Ridgeworld Sprawl is a city like no other. The Spine, the
very top of the mountain range, is home to some of the most exclusive
and expensive properties in the world. The farther down the mountain you
go, the farther below the poverty line you fall. The dregs of society,
the downtrodden and poor, exist at the bottom, working ever harder to
feed the machine.

## Atlanta Core 

A city-state unto itself, Atlanta Core exists fully inside the borders
of Ridgeworld Sprawl. Atlanta Core represents a carrying forward of
traditions and community. It embraces technology, music, art, and
nature, and the people who live there share a common belief that the key
to humanity is each other.

## Region: Old New England, The Shallows (Anneau Oui)

Once known as New England, the cradle of the American experiment, this
region is now a patchwork of shattered coastlines, sunken cities, and
wild hilltops. The tectonic chaos of the Great Upheaval caused the land
to fracture, sink, and be slowly consumed by the encroaching Atlantic.
Over 300 years, the area transformed into a broad, shallow sea broken by
rocky islands, half-drowned highlands, and flooded ruins.

To outsiders, it's *The Shallows*.

To the locals, many of whom can trace their lineage back to
French-speaking settlers who migrated here from Quebec, *Anneau Oui* is
its true name.

![](media/image5.jpeg){width="4.395833333333333in"
height="4.395833333333333in"}

As the land disappeared underwater, so too did the old names. Some held
on to "New England," but in time, it became *Old* New England, and then,
eventually, just O.N.E. It was under this name that a new government was
born, led by Thomas Peabody, a man who believed himself to have a
singular vision, and who managed to convince those around him to
organize and rebuild.

What started as a reconstruction was quickly derailed by Peabody's
capricious whims. The people resented the new leadership for what they
said were the acts of a tyrant king. Those who criticized the fledgling
government flipped the lettering of the region's new name and began to
call it N.O.E, or New Old England, as an insult, an allusion to the old
kings of the past.

Years later, when migrants from Quebec arrived on these salty isles,
they were eager to join and help this community. By this time, the area
had been dubbed, *the Shallows*, by outsiders, the government still
referred to themselves as O.N.E., and the locals were still calling it
N.O.E. out of spite.

To these French-speaking people, however, N.O.E. was often misheard as
\"Anneau Oui.\" This linguistic turn took on meaning for those folk, and
many now refer to the area by that name. To them, it variously means,
\"The Circle of Those Who Said Yes,\" a reference to the people who made
this their new home, and \"The Yes Ring,\" meaning, the loop of coastal
lands and adjoining archipelago, a \"ring\" created by the rising waters
of the Atlantic.

Today, Peabody's rule is all but forgotten. The people choose to
remember the name they gave to this place instead. Anneau Oui. A promise
whispered across the tides: *Yes, the circle remains*.
