# Folding Stock

A \[Folding Stock\] is built into or attached to a firearm and helps reduce \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Recoil|Recoil]]\]. It can be deployed or folded in combat by spending 1 AP. When deployed, your second \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Attack|Attack]]\] with the same weapon on the same turn ignores \[Recoil\]. If you make a third \[Attack\], \[Recoil\] is applied. If a weapon with a \[Folding Stock\] is also \[[[Lexicon/Keywords/Keyword_Concealable|Concealable]]\], it loses the \[Concealable\] quality while the \[Folding Stock\] is deployed. \[Folding Stock\] does not stack with \[[[Gas_Vents|Gas Vents]]\].
