# Qualities

Qualities are short, freeform descriptors that are not specifically defined by the game's rules. A quality is an aspect of a person, place, or thing. When the GM [[Making a Roll|calls for a roll]], each quality relevant to the situation raises or lowers the [[Difficulty Level]].

For example, [[Rico]] the food cart vendor has the quality, \[Needs the Money\]. Qualities like this can help inform the GM's roleplaying and decision making. 

A quality like \[Needs the Money\] means the character probably prioritizes their income and savings over other aspects of their life. They are likely to be thrifty or even penny-pinching.

Places and things can have qualities too. A night club might have the qualities, \[Loud\], \[Dark\], and \[Packed\], or a wooden door could have the quality, \[Solid Oak\], which speaks to its sturdiness and difficulty to break down.

The same quality can raise one Difficulty Level while lowering another. For example, the quality \[Dark\] makes it harder to scan the room and find your friends, so it would raise the DL by one. On the other hand, if you are trying to hide, the \[Dark\] is a benefit, so it would lower the DL by one.

Qualities are added and removed as appropriate. For example, during the day, when the maintenance crew is working, the night club no longer has the qualities \[Dark\], \[Loud\], or \[Packed\] because the lights are on, there's no music, and only a handful of workers are present.
