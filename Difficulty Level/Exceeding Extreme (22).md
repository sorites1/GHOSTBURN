# Exceeding Extreme (22)

As you [[Adjusting Difficulty Level|adjust the Difficulty Level]] by layering on more and more modifiers, you may find yourself going past Extreme (22). When this happens, keep going and refer to extra levels as Extreme (+1), Extreme (+2), and so on.

For example, consider a character who is making an attack against a target.

- For this attack, the skill action dictates the base DL is Moderate (10).
- The GM says the target is at long range.
- Each range increment beyond short raises the DL by one.
- Going from short to medium range raises the DL to Hard (14).
- Going from medium to long range raises the DL to Severe (18).
- The GM adds \[Dark\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (22).
- The GM adds \[Rain\], which raises the DL by one to Extreme (+1).

After the GM finishes raising the DL, proceed with lowering the DL according to modifiers identified by the player. If the player is unable to reduce the DL to Extreme (22) or lower, then what they are trying to do is not possible. You cannot [[Making a Roll|make a roll]] if the DL is Extreme (+1) or higher.
