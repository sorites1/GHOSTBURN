## Setting the Base Difficulty Level

Each skill action includes an entry for [[Difficulty Level]] (DL), which determines how easy or difficult it is to execute. 

The DL used by a skill action can be based on one of the target's ***[[Traits|traits]]***, the skill action's ***[[Skill Action DL Chart|DL chart]]***, or a ***[[Static DL|static DL]]***.
